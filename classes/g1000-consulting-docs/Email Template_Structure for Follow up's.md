Step 1: Before you write anything
Go back and review the transcript from your meeting. Then open Doc 2: Building Blocks of the G1000 Ultimate Tech Guide and use it to map what you heard to problem categories. This will help you move from "they mentioned a pain point" to "here's what's actually solvable and how."
As a group, rank the issues by impact and priority — based on how the owner talked about them, not just what was said.

Step 2: Structure your email
Look at it this way — the best follow-up email does three things: makes the owner feel heard, shows you understood the business, and earns a second meeting. Model your email after this structure:

1. Reframe the core issue Don't just list problems. Show that you understand what's actually going on underneath the surface. What is the real bottleneck — not the symptom?
2. Pain points you identified What were the main challenges or frustrations the owner expressed? Reference specific things they said.
3. Three strategic follow-up questions These should open the door to a second meeting. Think about what you didn't get deep enough into — what would help you better understand the business process or root cause behind the pain point you identified?
4. What you're NOT recommending (and why) This is what separates a good consultant from a great one. Show you thought critically about what doesn't apply to their situation and why.
5. One concrete recommendation Not a list of ideas — one focused, well-reasoned recommendation. Use Doc 2 to identify the right approach and explain what it would actually look like for their business. Be specific.
