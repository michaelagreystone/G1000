Transcript:
 
Speaker A: So yeah, our business is changing quite a bit recently too, in the sense that we used to be more of a, what I would consider classic fix it real estate developer, where we would buy assets and I'd say loosely, office assets at deeply discounted prices where they had heavy vacancy holes and then we would go in and polish them up and clean up the lobbies, the bathrooms, the common area amenities and would bring it back to the market and kind of a new showcase formula and hope that, you know, tenants would buy into the changes we made and then sign longer term leases with the building. And I think that formula worked for a long time. Pre pandemic and then post pandemic, it's like required another whole level in the sense of it's not, it's not satisfactory to just change the building itself from, you know, dated to modern. It really now takes what I would call some sort of activation. And the activation typically is amenity driven or it's driven by. And amenities used to always be the thing. You know, do you have a great gym, do you have a great common area, you know, experience and those kinds of things. But now it's come down to are you really like kind of like a mixed use project if you're in an office park like this one? Right. You know, as soon as we put in the health and wellness concepts and you know, the golf simulator, the B tone, the fresh monkey, as soon as that stuff came to this building, it went from 80% vacant to 100% leased. And so I think like now more than ever, it's not a question. The almost the last decision tree is to reposition offices, better office or office to more office. It's always that's the last decision on a matrix of what's the underlying zoning, what's the entitlements that are allowed by Bright, what are the likely overlay approaches that you can use to enhance the office building, even if it means, hey, we've got these satellite parking lots like we were in front of Westboro last night to entitle the back parking lots for 260 units of, of multi family and then two separate standalone mixed use buildings with the idea in mind that it would activate the office building significantly to have housing in now retail near it. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: Whereas we could have just done what I would consider like the cash out check that Egan just did next door to us. And he, he sold 29 acres to a church, the same church that wanted to buy our parking lot not for 14 because it was a smaller piece, but 5 to 7 and we ultimately decided, you know, it would actually be a detractor telling tenants, well, Saturday and Sunday there's no parking at the office building because there's 1500 cars here for church services. It's like almost the opposite effect. So ironically, towns are starting to get on board with it. You know, like Marlboro's success over there with entitling 187, you know, apartments that's for sale product. Two of the parking lots are former, one's a former satellite parking where you actually walk up the hill to get to the office building because office offices generally have a very high car parking ratio. So we have ultimately entitled two new construction buildings and then a revamp of the office building itself. Yeah. 
Speaker B: Okay, great. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: In relation to this meeting, I have a couple sections that I want to highlight just to make make sure I get an overall view of the company. 
Speaker A: Right. 
Speaker B: First off, just for a couple context questions, how many employees are in Ferris Development Group and how many employees are in Beehive? 
Speaker A: If you had approximate, I would just say approximately, I would say there is probably 15 in development. There's probably 20 in 20 to 25 in Beehive, and then there's probably four in like expedited construction or expedited engineering. So there's probably like 15 that are what I would call 1099. 
Speaker B: Okay. 
Speaker A: Yeah. So it's probably a total of like 60 in the ecosystem. 
Speaker B: So for expedited construction, is that under its own entity? 
Speaker A: It is, yeah. 
Speaker B: Okay. 
Speaker A: As is expedited engineering. 
Speaker B: So. 
Speaker A: So they're separate branded entities that perform totally different tasks. By way of example, the engineering company probably has 100 third party developers that it does engineering. Where's the sidewalk go? Where's the fire hydrant go? And that's primarily run by two guys that are civil engineers. 
Speaker B: So these two guys are really the glue for expedited engineering. 
Speaker A: Correct. And they do. We're one customer. Ferris Development. Right. Yeah. 
Speaker B: So just articulating more on that how like without these two guys, are they in the process every day, in every process, to make sure everything flows. And if they're not there, is it more friction? 
Speaker A: No, they're. They're almost like what I would call completely independent to us, other than when we're a customer engaging them for one work. So there's the big parking lot out front right now being torn up. 
Speaker B: Yep. 
Speaker A: They gave us a plan on a bunch of piece of paper saying this is where the water, this is where the new drainage line is going to go. This is where we're going to put manhole covers. Give this to your third party contractor and let him dig this trench. They got out there and they realized the civil engineer company that we hired, our own company never marked the main water line, and they hit it and broke it. So we had a giant eruption of water the other night when the third party contractor looks at the plant and says, there's no water line, well, in theory, there's a redundancy. That contractor should have done his own dig safe, and he didn't. And so now that engineering company will redraw the plans for us to accommodate it. So now we have men inside the building instead of digging two feet, digging six feet down to change the elevations. Long story short, but the answer is they're pretty autonomous. So it's almost like a mini practice of just a civil engineering company. They have their own book of clients that I don't even know the names of who they cover. But I ran into a developer randomly last night. He said, wait, you're. You're expedite engineering? I work with so and so and so. You know, that kind of thing. 
Speaker B: Okay, yeah, gotcha. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: So out of, like, who would you say are the key people that you rely on most to keep things running when you're not here? 
Speaker A: It would typically be Brian Charville, who is the head of the real estate company. So he's general counsel and chief operating officer. So he runs the day to day of the operations in the real estate. So hr, he finance reports to him in that finance team is pretty much led by Madison Scott. And then Kevin McCall. And then. And then on the Beehive side, which would be where we have a lot of people, it would be Kevin Puquette, who runs operations for Beehive. And then it would be like James, who runs H Vac. And then it would be those would be the main guys. And then in plumbing, everybody's kind of independent and rolls up to, you know, the half a dozen plumbers or so roll up to Kevin. And then we have expedited construction, which is really Chris and Kelsey, and they kind of do all the coordinating for construction. So Beehive is a customer to expedited, but expedited uses third parties to do stuff as well. 
Speaker B: Right. So what would occur if one of these people, like the core people that gets things done, isn't available at a certain time? 
Speaker A: So if it wasn't Brian, it would be George, who's redundant for legal. And then if it wasn't Brian, it would probably go right to Kevin. Or if it's finance Go to Kevin or Madison. And then, and then people below that are more like data entry, bookkeeping kind of people who are updating the finance books. And then if it's anything touching, leasing or you know, tenant, you know, for lack of a better term, terms and conditions, it would go to Ryan, who runs asset management. So if it's anything related to buying a property, selling a property, leasing a property, it's generally Ryan's. And then Ryan would report up into Brian. 
Speaker B: Great. So even if the head or the glue person per se isn't available, you still have a way of communicating that everyone knows what their roles and responsibilities. 
Speaker A: 100%. 
Speaker B: Okay. 
Speaker A: Yeah. It's a very small ecosystem where for lack of a better term, there's like a lot of what I would call cross pollinization where everybody knows what everybody else is doing and they kind of know who knows the answers to questions that we need, you know. 
Speaker B: Great. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: So in a typical week, where does the majority of your time go and is there something that you think it should be going toward that it isn't? 
Speaker A: Yeah, my time goes to. So I try and think of it as recently leading from the decision of I want to make generally less than 50 decisions a day. And so I try and think of my. My job in the company is to empower the people under me with the most information, make the best decisions in my, my behalf. That's one, two is unless it's an irreversible decision, empower the person to make the decision for you. Unless it's a super expensive decision. Again, empower the person to make the decision. So on things that are large dollar amounts, I want to make sure that they've been price checked and we have loose policies in that. But there's a lot of autonomy. People generally know the rules of the road, but I get surprised sometimes on things that like we spent that much and we didn't check, you know, but we. So. So I would say the majority. My day is looking over what I would call the biggest levers that can impact the company. So right now we're building a $45 million drug recovery center and that's in Chelmsford. So my day starts at 6am Unlocking the door and walking with the men through the threshold and making sure all the teams working framing and plumbing and H vac and electric are actually productive. And then my day is also working closely with the head of construction. We have eight build outs going on right now that range from 16,000 for a co working center at research to a 12,000 trial court, you know, where we're doing a file system with fire retardant walls and special electrical surge stuff for their computerization and modernization of the courts trial records. So we're building that 12,000 and then we're building 8,000 for a general printing company, advanced printing and then 8,000 for like a Runway show company and then 5,000 for another behavioral health, Worcester Behavioral health, like a detox kind of program, office space and then a fresh monkey juice bar, media center. So we're closing in on finishing eight of those to put more of the company's effort into this, into this, for lack of a better term, large project. We have a second large project that's about to kick off, which is our, our 76 unit condo conversion office to residential in Marlboro that probably kick off in 60 days or less. And but to answer the question, a lot of like what I'm thinking about in terms of capital allocation, because high growth companies, one of the biggest pain points is how much capital you have to get from A to B to C to D to E. And so you want to be efficient with time that it takes to get things done, but also how much are you spending relative to what your capital base is. And so I think like for, for me, one of the things I see missing in our organization is a fail safe price check on large components. So I was standing on a job site this morning, found out we bought 50 Simmons shower valves from FW Web. Well, FW Webb orders probably 90% of our plumbing and H Vac equipment. And I venture to guess that if somebody put a little bit of time into that, other than going with the default provider, we probably would have saved, I don't, I don't even know, I don't know what the dollars worth of the order. But we ordered, I don't know, 36, $38,000 worth of stuff the other day. And I know I'm pretty confident nobody went back and said, okay, well let's do an itemized check with three other providers and see kind of what the costs of those products would be if we had time and flexibility for when we get delivery. And which we do in this case because the plumbing's not ready to be, the valves aren't ready to be installed. But so there's things like that that come up daily, you know, where, you know, today. And this would be a more customized kind of thing. It's, you know, hey, we got a quote from the first provider for 126,000 of duct work. Another provider quoted us 46,000, but it didn't include elbows. So. Okay, well, what are those elbows cost and are we better off buying from vendor A or vendor B? So those are things that I like to ask a lot of questions. So I know, you know, the swing on that question could be 10, 20 grand. I also like to know timing of tenancy in terms of when a tenant's going in place. So I know the mass trial court in the back of my mind has no free rent. It's basically the day they occupy. They start paying. Well, then that job should take a higher precedence than one that I have to wait for, burning off free rent, even though technically they both started. One is cash flowing from the day. It takes occupancy. 
Speaker B: Right? 
Speaker A: You know, definitely. And. And then there's also what I would consider a tone and culture setting where, you know, I got a big, burly master electrician who's been mouthing off to a lot of people, made a woman uncomfortable in the workplace, and, you know, is, you know, less than friendly to people. And, you know, I've gotten several feedback, you know, blurbs in the last two weeks have been pretty poor. And, you know, I go on the job site 15 minutes before he got here, and he's sitting there on his phone in a dark room, which means he hasn't moved enough to even activate the light sensors in 15, 20 minutes of it. You know, normally don't get louder, verbally, you know, aggressive, but it's just so offensive. It goes against all the policies. Like, I sent you an email telling you this. Deliverable in this trial court's wiring was due by last Friday. You asked till Wednesday. You're not going to remotely be done probably even by this Friday. And it's no wonder you're standing here with the other guy under you on your phone, not working. Yeah, just. You're going to be reprimanded and disciplined publicly for that. 
Speaker B: Definitely. 
Speaker A: So it sets a tone, you know, to the younger guy. 
Speaker B: Yeah. 
Speaker A: Holy shit. You know, this big burly boss, like, just, you know, collapsed in front of the boss, you know, but so. So my day is spent, for lack of a better term, making sure people are accountable for delivering what they're supposed to deliver. 
Speaker B: Okay. 
Speaker A: You know, and then Brian, as chief operating officers, for lack of a better term, fully responsible for onboarding new staff, putting together terms and conditions of employment, making sure necessary covenants are in place for employees, and then also disciplinary issues with staff. Also basic HR functionality, you know, in terms of compliance with, you know, regulatory landscapes and HR Related stuff. And then also, you know, healthcare benefits and things that employees would enjoy and making sure we're maximizing what we're spending to get employees the best benefit for what, what we're allocating, which is a lot of money for this stuff. 
Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah. So I would say just to simplify even further, if you had a magic wand, right, and you could get any important process that you needed completed without your oversight, what would that be without any limitations inside of your company? 
Speaker A: One of the biggest ones would be financial reporting. It would be modeling financial statistics to show me impact of new tenancy, show me the completion of project dates and revenue in and revenue out and profitability of each business unit, and cost savings based on procurement efficiency. So if we're for lack of a better term, performing in house work, how, like how does that impact our bottom line versus hiring a third party? So a great example would be, you know, we just finished half of the fire heads at 300 bill record. We got a third party bid. One was 84, one was 91,000. It's basically take those heads, turn them up, you know, 90 degrees, 180 and make them face the ceiling. So third party plumbers, two of them quoted 84 and 91. So I keep that in my back pocket and think, do I want to use them or am I going to use my own guys? And then looking at our third party software app and measuring how many hours did we pay staffing to go out there and do that activity? And then what was the net benefit to the company on that, on that particular job in house versus exterior? So we're halfway done on that. And I know our costs are probably in terms of material costs, sub 10,000 we paid a third party for the fire permitting, that's 2100, 21, 50. So it really is just a very simple calculation of how many hours did we have men up there turning those heads up. And I venture to guess our actual labor cost is probably, I'm going to guesstimate based on 3 or 4 guys sub 20 grand. So that kind of gives me an earmark. Okay, that's half of it. So we're probably somewhere around 15 or 20 grand ahead for that half. So on that total job, we probably say 40, 45 grand, you know, but understanding that and then rolling it up into a cohesive kind of finance model that says on this project, here's how you're tracking relative to your total budget. You know, you put this in. So converting some of the human hours on the beehive side to tasks and profitability per project that we're touching? 
Speaker B: You know what I mean? No, definitely. What would you say are the tasks that frequently come up that you and your team might spend a little more time than you need to without adding a whole lot more strategic value? 
Speaker A: Right. Probably dialogue with banks, you know, where we're, you know, finding and sourcing financing relationships to fund capital projects. It tends to be one of these things where the outreach, you know, if you, if you haven't maintained a great set of dinners and steaks with certain guys, it becomes a real clusterfuck to get financing completed. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: And, and so it ends up being a lot of time of asset management. It becomes time for finance, becomes time for me trying to push that process through. So that's one that's big. I would say capital allocation because, you know, depending on when transactions are closing sales and strategic, you know, refinancings and things like that, capital in high growth companies is always tight. And so you want to make sure that, that you're meeting all your existing commitments and setting aside money for when you have your next project. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: You know what I mean? 
Speaker B: Definitely. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: Okay, so how do you currently find and evaluate new development opportunities and what does the process look like from the time you identify it to the time you close on it? 
Speaker A: Yeah, it's typically a lot of it is still very, for lack of a better term, not archaic, but it's very basic. It's the best deals are the ones that aren't online, they're not in a database, they're not, they're not really visible to the broader public. They're more A broker knows this is rolling off or this is coming to market because this, this and this are happening. And so the beauty of our ecosystem is we have talent internally that can now take a, you know, land area and do an overlay, for lack of a better term, and determine with the legal counsel what uses are allowed in the box. And then they can come to me and say these are the right uses. This area is wet. This is what we have dry, that's flat. This is the parking ratio. This is what might, what, what do you think would be highest and best use. And so often I can see opportunities that the rest of the team don't necessarily see where with certain, you know, legal overlay or zoning approvals or special situations, we're working with the town like Marlboro. That building we paid, you know, four or five for wasn't legally entitled to be housing. It took an overlay by the city council it took the city council understanding that we were a financial, you know, financially responsible partner that would write a check for 5, 700 grant to help the city on its fire station and other things and then delivering and doing what we said we'd do. But also effectively the deal sourcing has gotten to a point where we've become so efficient with properties we're buying. We've now created through our in house permitting a backlog of projects where we can do construction. Like there's an entitlement rate at the corner of the back of the this parking lot for a 60 unit apartment building. Right. So in the old days we would have never even known we could have done it, but we found a 40B piece of rules and regulations that allowed us to stick that there. You know, like the Marlboro situation. When we bought it, we thought, oh, hey, we'll just, you know, convert this office building. We're way ahead of the game. We get the foundation framing. Yeah, we'll put new windows in and elevator core is great. You know, 76 units will make, you know, I don't know, 10 million on this project. It's pretty easy. And then as we started to do the civil engineering overlay, we recognized the opportunity to make another 5 million through selling permitted land. So, you know, it's a lot like Westboro Research Drive where we've owned that for 10, 12 years. We've had a functional office building. We're in front of the town last night to get approvals for these units that probably add 12 million in value to the property that was sitting near a vacant parking lot for last door years, you know, so the capability set now that the company has to convert property into highest and best uses is the core inner strength that most firms can't carry. The payroll of an engagement to an engineering company in Boston to do overlays on projects that 8 out of 10 of them might have no potential ability because they're on wetland or because they're not that the zoning doesn't work or anything else. Where we own a captive company that's still profitable, we're able to get that done effectively for free, you know. 
Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. 
Speaker A: And still have that company. Make, make, make, make. 
Speaker B: So what does communication look like between inside the company with your team, A and E, general contractors, and also outside stakeholders like municipalities, surrounding communities and lenders. And where does that tend to break down in communication? 
Speaker A: I think I have a very strong policy internally that face to face meetings should always happen as a first and primary method of communication with colleagues and vendors and suppliers generally directly, if you possibly can, if you can't, a phone call. If you can't do a phone call and you have to send a text message just to update someone, then that's the third level of, like, communication. And email tends to be the last. Like, I was writing an email to the governor like, an hour ago, and I cc'd on, like, the head of the Secretary of Housing, who I had a conversation with, like two years ago on some workforce housing, and then they had a national grid who actually left, who's a liaison. And I didn't realize they had left. And so I had a bad email. But, you know, within 15 minutes, the housing director is like, look, we'd like to try and help. Let's get on a zoom call tomorrow at 4. And so we have a zoom call with them. But I would say that that's like. I mean, I could. I could, you know, count on my hands in the last three months how many emails like that I sent. I just don't. I don't like email. I don't read it very much. And so I'm a very verbal kind of communication thing with people. I think that I do a lot of group texts with people, so everyone's on the same page. I believe in sort of generally radical transparency. You know, there's nothing we have to hide. You know, we're not. We're not doing things that we shouldn't be doing. And we want everybody on the same page. I generally, you know, other than today, you know, discipline people in private. Unless I think the guy who's under him called in sick from being drunk yesterday, and you ought to see what happens, you know, so. But the. I. I don't know that we really have a breakdown in communication. I think we have a breakdown in the communication that might be verbal to the staff members about getting something done. So a great example would be releasing up a co workspace. I say to the two or three people, you know, I strongly would suggest you on the website for Boston Cowork, take out of the 22 spots, take 2/3 of them. And mark reserved, reserved, pending, you know, March 1, April 14, put some random dates reserved as these new six to 10 prospects that you have, they're about sign. Look, they have less choices, but they also have a higher sense of urgency. I said that two months ago. Well, now it's gonna open in two weeks. So you're gonna have one or two people sitting in 20 different pods and offices rather than, you know, you had a lot of Good tours, but everybody felt like, I got plenty of time. There's a lot of, A lot of availability, you know, a lot. Like the way we do it in the beehive. Not we, but my third party does it with the management of the beehive facilities. It's, it's, hey, we've got one 10 by 10 left. They might have two or three, but they got one left at this price. So they're like airline tickets. 
Speaker B: Scarcity factor. 
Speaker A: Yeah, scarcity. Selling scarcity. And so I think that, I think the breakdown is I say it thinking they understand I'm the boss. I give maybe a month to every employee, three maybe extreme five recommendations about how to do your job. Because generally if you're in that position, you should be doing it better than I can do it. So if I'm telling you, then I'm sort of training you at this point. So you should probably take that, implement it immediately. 
Speaker B: So do you feel like it's more of it's just going over their head because they have too many other things to do or. 
Speaker A: I don't think it's going over their head. I think it's. I get so many other things to do. I'm not prioritizing the boss's comments. And yeah, I'll get to that when I'm ready. As opposed to yesterday. I finally put it back black and white. Said, I brought this up now six to seven times. All of you haven't implemented this. Get it done by end of day. And I walked over, still wasn't done on the inside of the building. And I just thought this is nuts. So some sort of matrix that verbal commands go into. And I tried to kind of loosely implement it into this TV screen model where everybody kind of knows that now internally, the worst thing a company at our size can handle have is any project or deliverable without a deadline. So everything they touch should have a deadline associated with it. Without deadlines, you're a dying company. And at this size, you know what I mean? With 60 staff members. So I think that from my standpoint, the best thing we can do is make sure everybody understands they're held accountable to completing what they're saying, supposed to with a given deadline, you know, because. Yeah, deadlines help create a priority matrix, enforce the discussion. I know you want that done, but I can't get that in this done. So which. And how should we do this? 
Speaker B: Ranks the urgency. 
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Speaker B: Okay. So if you were able to, because. 
Speaker A: You'Re only here 30,000 days, you understand that? 
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. 
Speaker A: That's not a lot of time. It's not, it's a very small number. 
Speaker B: If you are able to double your profit to work ratio, what would be your first thought that comes to your mind to address that solution? 
Speaker A: To get to double the profit with the work solution? Yeah, it would be to create with. 
Speaker B: The same like workforce ratio. 
Speaker A: Same workforce ratio would be to get more third party jobs. So it'd be marketing and sales to Beehive like so it'd be more third party jobs for behavior. Beehive were incoming external customers. So the way the, the revenue on that business unit will strike up this year. So say it was six months in existence in 2024. So it was June to December to about 800 grand. So maybe like 125 000amonth. Last year it did like 3 million. So it did, you know, I don't know. Call it 250000 thousand a month. This year it, you know, 26, it'll do 10 to 12 million. But of the 10 to 12 million, 6 of it'll probably be captive, meaning captive 6 to 7 will be working on projects that I own. We should be at the point now where we went from service last year at the very end of the year we did our first major install. We did our own install on Beehive. We put in a, you know, half a million to $700,000 heating and cooling system, brand new and our cost other than was just labor, the materials were effectively rebated for free. So I think like for us to dramatically grow profitability with the exact same people we have, all we have to do is we have to create some training modules for some of our techs to understand how to do third party training calls. So there's a training component missing in the company where I think AI could be really helpful if we had H VAC training seminars that we pulled from any database out there and we forced text, you're going to do a minimum of two hours of training a week. These are the modules we like you on and here's how you present to the customer. So you become somewhat of a sales oriented solution provider. When there's a repair option, the repair option can still happen, but geez, you might be better off doing this replacement cycle. So that business unit right now stands to probably have the biggest impact of value to the company. I say that because the more third party work we do, the higher the valuation of that company on an EBITDA basis, on a multiple basis to a third party private equity shop or An IPO or something like that down the road. 
Speaker B: Yep. Something just to highlight. So you said third party instructional videos specifically pertaining to how your business unit works in course with the like existing employees would be massively beneficial. 
Speaker A: Yeah, I think like we like, we're contemplating sending techs now down to Tennessee to do training modules on H Vac basics, you know what I mean, to make sure they're comprehensive and fluent in the various areas that they should be for going out and doing third party work. In residential applications. We primarily been at the beginning the first year, 2024, commercial only. So we're fixing buildings like this for other building owners. Then in 25 we became still 90% commercial, 10% residential. Because we were on Martha's Vineyard, we didn't have the right techs. We got the stuff done, but it was a fucking shit show getting work done with the wrong people. We've now since hired some really quality guys who are eager to learn and are coming up the curve, but could use some formal training. So that formal training piece in Beehive is missing. And then the formal. What I would consider the most important holy grail thing I think for that business unit that we're trying to solve right now is third party LSA marketing for Google, where we could create some AI automated messaging and marketing and sales advertising to. To effectively, you know, grow that, Grow that third party client list. Sure. The way I would think of it now is beehives, about 400 customers, probably 150 of them are what I would say core customers from Bass Pro Shops to Marriott Sheraton and, you know, you name it, big companies. And then the rest are kind of individuals on Martha's Vineyard and you know, residential customers and nonprofits and the like. 
Speaker B: Gotcha. 
Speaker A: So One nonprofit has 85 houses that we manage for them locally. Yeah. 
Speaker B: You know, yeah. So obviously you go through a bunch of projects, what would you say, or what do you think has been the smoothest from start to finish versus one that turned out to be a total headache and what was the difference between how the two played out? 
Speaker A: Yeah, I would, I'm trying to, Sorry. 
Speaker B: Just to preface, like frame the question a little more. I'm just trying to understand what, like, what workflows really worked for you guys and what was a little harder for you guys to get through. 
Speaker A: So I think, I think permitting and land entitlement is a very unpredictable timeline. So we have, you know, know, for lack of a better term, struggled with mapping out the exact timing of when, you know, a deliverable can be met. So it's very hard at the beginning. You know, you can put your hand in the air like we did on the Marlboro project, say, well, we think it'll take about a year. The city says about a year, takes about a year and three quarters. And then we find out, oh, there's this whole other chapter and some of that's coming up, the learning curve where you got to get the power company to actually give you the power to do the, the project. So you know, there's some of that stuff that comes along and you can still get to the right result, which is very financially enriching result. But I think like in it depends on which company, the answer would be very different. So I think of my condo at 288 Comm Ave. 6, eight years ago when I built that, it looked like a simple, you know, gut reno job that we'd done stuff like that. And it didn't look that, that complicated. But it became an absolute horror show because we didn't have experienced people who ran Boston projects before. And so it lingered on, took a long time and the cost was extremely high because it's debt finance projects. Right. So real estate is a levered investment by nature. Most people don't use 100 cash. So every day that you're paying on the meter, you know, burns capital. And so I think that, you know, that would be an example of the return set became almost impossible at some point, you know, where the projected sellout didn't matter if you hit it. The debt costs were so high to carry the thing, you weren't going to make money on the project. And so I think like with, with construction that can happen, but it can also happen with permitting. So it all comes down to deliverables and timeline and meeting, you know, timelines and goals, you know, in lease up. So you know, with property, you know, if you're buying it vacant, you're by definition taking some significant risk and you've got to get it to, you know, lease and cash flow definitely. So I've got one call I'm supposed to get on at one being texted about. Any more questions or. 
Speaker B: No, not really. We can end it here. 
Speaker A: But I can finish them in the car with you if you want, if that's easier. 
Speaker B: No, no, it's all good. I'm just going to go home anyway. I might come back here to stop at the bank. 
Speaker A: I'll probably be here till like 3 or 4 o'. Clock. You need to swing back by. 
Speaker B: Okay, yeah, sounds great. I think this was great. Though I do appreciate it. 


Ferris Overview 1
Meeting Title: Pt 1 Ferris Overview
Date: Feb 18 - 12:20-1pm
Business Evolution & Strategy
* Shifted from traditional “fix-it” real estate development to activation-driven projects post-pandemic
   * Old model: Buy discounted vacant office assets, polish lobbies/bathrooms, hope for tenant interest
   * New model: Requires mixed-use activation with amenities (health/wellness, golf simulator, Fresh Monkey)
   * Example success: Building went from 80% vacant to 100% leased after adding activation elements
* Current approach prioritizes overlay zoning opportunities over simple office-to-office conversions
   * Westboro project: Entitled back parking lots for 260 multifamily units + 2 mixed-use buildings to activate main office
   * Rejected $5-7M church sale (would create weekend parking conflicts) in favor of development activation
Company Structure & Key Personnel
* Total ecosystem: ~60 people across multiple entities
   * Ferris Development: ~15 employees
   * Beehive: 20-25 employees
   * Expedited Construction: 4 employees
   * Expedited Engineering: ~15 contractors (1099s)
* Key leadership dependencies:
   * Brian Charville: General counsel/COO, runs day-to-day operations, HR, finance oversight
   * Kevin McCall & Madison Scott: Finance team leads
   * Kevin Puquette: Beehive operations head
   * James: HVAC operations
   * Ryan: Asset management (leasing, buying, selling properties)
* Built-in redundancy: George backs up Brian for legal, cross-pollination culture where “everybody knows what everybody else is doing”
Current Operations & Growth Areas
* Major active projects:
   * $45M drug recovery center in Chelmsford (daily 6am site walks)
   * 8 simultaneous buildouts ranging from $16K coworking to $12K trial court with specialized systems
   * 76-unit condo conversion in Marlboro (starting in 60 days)
* Beehive revenue trajectory: $800K (6 months 2024) → $3M (2025) → projected $10-12M (2026)
   * Current split: 60% captive work, 40% third-party target
   * Competitive advantage: In-house work saves 40-50% vs third-party bids ($84-91K external vs ~$20K internal for fire head project)
Process Improvement Opportunities
* Financial reporting gaps: Needs automated modeling for project profitability, completion tracking, procurement efficiency analysis
* Communication challenges: Verbal directives not consistently implemented despite repeated requests
   * Example: Coworking space scarcity marketing strategy ignored for 2 months
   * Solution attempt: TV screen deadline tracking system, “everything needs a deadline”
* Banking/financing relationships require excessive manual relationship management
* Missing training infrastructure: Beehive techs need formal HVAC training modules and AI-powered sales training for third-party work expansion
* Procurement oversight: Large purchases (like $38K plumbing order) lack systematic price comparison protocols

Meeting Title: Pt 2 Ferris - Transcript
Date: Feb 18 - 3:30-4:15pm


Speaker A = Michael Greystone (myself)
Speaker B = David Ferris


Transcript:
 
Speaker A: All right, part two. 
Speaker B: Fantastic. 
Speaker A: So just a couple more things. So part of your operation now? I'm trying to understand your growth challenges and bottlenecks. 
Speaker B: Yep. 
Speaker A: What part of your operation right now feels like it takes 10 steps when really it should only take 3? 
Speaker B: Getting ads online, direct marketing to consumers, you know, that's very like people intensive where somebody's getting a video, somebody's gotta get the LSA account approved, which we did. But then the content has to be written. That's something that AI could speed up dramatically for us, you know, so it's advertising and marketing to specific campaigns. So it'd be like, you know, there's a cold snap coming, emergency self burrow plumbing, and then those ads, we're looking at a weather forecast and knowing we're gonna 30, 40 calls from that over a weekend. Gotcha. 
Speaker A: So it's more targeted marketing. 
Speaker B: Targeted marketing that's timely, you know, as opposed to just broad campaigns. That would be for like beehive for development. I would have said six months ago, leasing, but we're signing. We just signed eight leases for this building, this building and another building, well, three buildings. But this building's now 100%, you know, so with the exception of the IRS, which will have to backfill. So we'll do some targeted ads for that. But that's one of those things that seems like it takes 10 steps to get good, for lack of a better term, pop up ads out to the marketplace. So that's something where we should be doing more timely. We know the IRS is vacating. We know we can split that space into three to five suites. We should be putting a quick concept plan, even if it's like half baked and it's just some lines on a piece of paper. Or we throw the floor plan into like a chatgpt bot that says show a five retail plan layout. It would do that in literally three minutes. That if I sent it to an architect, I'd be waiting days to get it back. And it's always going to change anyway. It's just going to be whatever a tenant wants. But it just plants that seed into the marketplace. That could be a marketing opportunity where right now, you know, it might take like Ariela kind of superimposing something and you know, then that's pulling her out of beehive sales, which isn't good. And then it could be Eric getting diverted, you know. But like a great example would be we had this layout for the cowork space that had 25 units. And I said, you should put Reserved on two thirds of them. You know, I say it seven times. It's not because they don't want to do it, it's because I'm not. Not sure how to do that. And with the right AI tool and a photo AI, you could just say, please mark two thirds of these, save the best ones for later rentals, mark them, res, and then put a price list together using the prices you see on the sheet. It'll be done in five minutes. And then you'd say, you know, load this onto my existing website page and it'd be done in 10 minutes. You know, instead, it's just taking way too long, you know, definitely. So it's almost like a utility player between the companies. That's not necessarily sales or marketing. It's not necessarily web design. It's not necessarily, you know, layouts or architectural renditions. It's more knowing how to use technology to get at least draft stuff that's pretty close to what we're supposed to be doing. You know what I mean? Thank you, Jody. I appreciate that. And then the other bottlenecks, I would say, are things like, you know, like today we just had an issue come up where the national grid company, huge company, is going to potentially take four to six months to do this, what I call feeder study, which basically is like studying the grid and what they have to do to upgrade it to power enough power for our three buildings. Right. And I'm sitting here now for the last four hours going on chat GPT and sort of trying to understand what's the best, for lack of a better term, internal, you know, process to cut the line to national grid, to get that down from four to six months to four to six weeks. 
Speaker A: Right. 
Speaker B: So there's different steps. Like go to this mayor and Marlboro, have them write a letter, an economic development zone, you know, you know, priority project that aligns with Governor Healy's, you know, need for new housing. So reach out to the second. So I'm kind of piecemealing together the action plan to do that. And. And if I don't do it, nobody else is going to do it. It'll just be, let's wait for six months. And that doesn't work. 
Speaker A: Right? 
Speaker B: You know, definitely, yeah. 
Speaker A: Time's money definitely in this business. So would you say is there a recurring problem that keeps showing up project after project that you haven't fully been able to solve yet? 
Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the biggest one is financial reporting around profitability and financial modeling. I think our finance department is way behind using Automated tools to take even like a spreadsheet dump of like project costs and then running it at a model and quickly saying show a draft P and L of where we stand, quarter to date, week to date, year to date, sales goals, you know, that kind of stuff. So that's the biggest piece that we haven't implemented that I could see. We would really, really lighten the load of reporting visibility. So it would say to me, okay, you know, this type of project ran at X dollars a square foot. Like I couldn't tell you like what we spent on the last eight jobs for electric per square foot. I should know that I have the data in here that tell me the electricians and how many hours they were building. It's just pulling that data out and then dumping it into a model that could give me visibility. So that when I go to the next iteration of that that makes the company more successful is once we understand the total costs that we're spending currently on our own stuff, we're in a better position to price it third party for other people to perform services at a profitable return. You know what I mean? Like I now know, you know, 50,000 square foot storage building, I could probably make that extremely profitable for our. If I price the equipment almost at zero cost to the consumer. Maybe, you know, the consumer has to pay 250,000, model in 50,000 of like non rebateable expenses for materials and then model in another, you know, 3 to 500,000 of labor and you probably, you know, still end up with a very nice return in terms of an install for a customer. You know what I mean? 
Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Now I just want to touch on going back to like people and communication. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: When you bring on a new hire, what does the ramp up process look like and how long does it take before they truly become a full speed contributor? 
Speaker B: Yeah, I would say in our trades practice we're missing what I would call some clips that are like mandatory. Watch these, know them, we're going to question you on them before you start. These are some things in your division of electric or your division of customer service. So we, we would be a lot better organization on the beehive side if when we agreed to hire someone we said, but by the way, we're going to give you some AI videos. You got to watch them, understand them. You're not going to be allowed out in the field there. And it's real simple. You get your truck after you pass a passing score. We did that with our interns and that was really effective. Like we Wouldn't let them drive the vehicles until they could drive stick, you know what I mean? Just safety. But I think like we don't have a lot of training. It's a lot of like learn on the job. So I think we could create for every new trade the, you know, guaranteed not to last at Ferris Company's video. Before you accept your offer, we'd ask that you watch it, you know, using your phone on the job for personal communication, social media and otherwise. You know, if the CEO season on a job, it's probably a one warning and then you're not going to be like, I went ballistic today. Yeah, not initially because of that, but the confluence of sending that senior guy who has the master license with the company setting a bad example for the younger guy. And then also the younger guy calling out yesterday due to alcohol issues and then, and then on top of it, the, the compounding effect of not showing leadership, a careful, at least well thought response or even a phone call. I got your text. I saw that the bank's doing an inspection on Friday. I won't be able to achieve your goal. So I think Wednesday is a more realistic goal, meaning this Wednesday. And then you're over there and you still haven't hit your goal and you're on your phone, like bad move all around, you know. Yeah. 
Speaker A: So would you say a video would be good enough or do you think it should be more experiential, like hands on? 
Speaker B: I think, I think a video is okay, but if it had a, you know, component of, you know, you're going to take this module and then you're going to be tested on it. And you can either test out before you get here or you can test out when you get here, but one way or the other you're going to test out before you start. 
Speaker A: Yep. 
Speaker B: You got to know these basics, you know what I mean? 
Speaker A: Yes, definitely. And how are you currently tracking project milestones, budgets and deadlines across the portfolio now? And do you feel there's like, there's. 
Speaker B: A lack of that? No, I don't. I mean it's always very Chris driven on deliverables for the construction projects. And so we could definitely be doing more interactive scheduling where you're out at a job site, you have some sort of app or thing that you're logging, you know, electric two thirds, framing two thirds that rolls up into a report each week that everybody sees. Okay, this is where we are on this project. Okay. So we got to push this. We're behind here. You know, there's none of that right now? 
Speaker A: Definitely. Okay. And then in terms of your competitive lands. 
Speaker B: Come in. Sir, how are you? Hey, good. I just got a guy in my office. What's up? Question for you. Yeah, Sent you a text. Yeah, I didn't see it. Pod one. Yeah. I've got a group, World Financial Group there originally interested in the management office. You told me about that. Three years. Three years. What do you think? Best price. We can do that. We have it listed at 3,000 right now. 
Speaker A: Three. 
Speaker B: Three year deal. Which pod is it? How many offices? Pod one is two offices. Two offices. And what do you think? You. What do you think's a realistic number? Three years? 2250, I think. So they're paying 2500 now. This space is way smaller than what they have. Right? What? What? Pod one is. Right. So they're looking for a quad one's first one on the right. Do it at 22.50 if you can get it done. Okay, yeah, Good. Thank you. 
Speaker A: Going back to. Oh, yeah. Competitive landscape. So are there any service lines or markets that you've thought about expanding into but haven't pulled the trigger yet? And if so, what's really held you back? 
Speaker B: Yeah, With Beehive, we're sticking to electrical plumbing. H vac Handyman is an a la carte for corporate customers or members. We're not looking to install basketball hoops. It's low margin loss business. We don't want to do it. We'll do it for the right customer to facilitate ease and convenience in their life. But so on Beehive, we're not looking to add any additional services. We are. We've kind of gone through three steps. We were a service company in year one in commercial. We were a service in residential partially in year two. And at the end of year two, we became a beginner installer. So now we're on. We finished service on both res and commercial. We know how to do that. We're now doing commercial install and we're doing my own projects first as a way to become confident and fluent that we know we can actually execute. And it's easier when it's your project because it doesn't matter to me if the pipes like 6 inches to the left or 6 inches to right because they're my plans and as long as the toilet's flush and it works. But in a corporate environment with a, you know, third party customer who has a third party engineer, they'll come and say, oh, no, no, no, no. The pipe is supposed to be 2 inches over here to the right, because I'm doing a special lighting feature that's like a no go, you know what I mean? So some of it is understanding our capability set. And the irony is we got asked by a lot of like, you know, big customers, hey, can you do this new heating install system? Be it via bar? And we were like, no. God, no, we're not. Right now we could partner with somebody to do that. You know, 18 months ago now we just did one on my building, you know what I mean? So we know how to do it now. We have different people in the chairs. So the level of professionalism to get those kinds of things done are different in terms of new businesses around. Like my dock line business I've kind of put on hold. But that's one that would really benefit with some advanced technology in the background that could run the updating of the app to make it more user friendly. Right now it's a very manual engineer code driven changes to the app. And so Dockline is what you use for basically it's almost like an Airbnb for dock owners in Florida that we have. And so we kind of mothballed it and have it kind of on hold right now just because we weren't getting a lot of traction. But some of it was because it was wonky to use and it's just a function of time. So I'm not looking to grow that at all in the next six to 12 months. 
Speaker A: So it's just renting out slips. 
Speaker B: Slips and then marking them up, you know, and then we were doing like boat show marketing and everything like that. But you know, it's running at least a half a million a year in carry costs. And I just like, you know what if it hasn't? I would not, I do not have enough intention for it. So I think the real estate company shifting where we used to be like a repair rehab, office tenant firm, we went to third party managing a remote large 50 million, $60 million shopping center lease up. We did really well with that. So we know how to do ret now. We did some retail here in our own building, but we're divesting that for more focus on the residential side. And so I, I could see our firm naturally evolving where when we Finish, you know, 130, which would be the next, you know, rehab. So the frame is already there, the foundation's already there, the utilities already going to the building. The next step would be actually gcing the whole project and bringing in a cement guy, bringing in a site guy, pouring a pad out here or doing 32 townhomes, which we're planning to do in Southborough behind that beehive building. So it'll probably be the. After Lazotte it would be the townhomes which would be like 32. And frankly, like for us, I was thinking about, I was originally just going to go modular because it's so easy to tie it in and we have people that can do that blindfolded. But the cost to build it is almost the same as stick built. And people really like stick builders built. So I think the play for us would be give it to a framer that could frame it, weather tighted windows, installed, fully framed, and then give it to us like bare bones, no H vac, heating, wiring, and then let us run the wiring and the heating. Very simple townhomes. And. And maybe we would do that, maybe not. Maybe we just put modular and call it a day. Because it's only a 30 unit project building. 
Speaker A: Right. 
Speaker B: Or facility. 
Speaker A: Right. Okay, now pivoting to financial and operational visibility, right. If you had to pick one thing in your operation that you feel is costing you extra money, but it's pretty hard to quantify, what would that be? 
Speaker B: The easiest one would be what I would call utility factor per day employees. Measuring employees on what they. What they've done. Not office employees. Office employees are generally doing work all day. Yeah, it's the shit that I just went through today. I have no fucking clue how many hours those idiots were standing there, but they were doing a lot of fucking off today. 
Speaker A: So specifically for be okay, so one. 
Speaker B: Of my most important, and I say beehive. It's really not beehive, it's beehive and construction. Holistically, one of the things missing in the construction industry is they call it the term a pusher. So I took one of the biggest bricks in the company that everybody hates. And. And he's not a pusher. He gets another couple hundred bucks on top of his normal pay and he works a lot of overtime. His name's Kenny. He's a real fucking pill to work with. He's a nice guy. I like him. I get along. He's a very respectful guy and he's about my age. But Kenny's job, on top of doing his daily responsibilities is going around and pushing, making sure people are doing, hey, what the fuck are you doing, guy? Yeah, like, why does this job site look like this? Why can't you pick up after yourself at the end of the day? Why do we have to send another employee over here to Clean up after you. Why don't you just do it? You're an electrician. The site looks like a shithole. So my point is, I just said to Kevin, I think the quickest way that I could get a massive return on my value of hours per day with employees, and it wouldn't be that big of an investment, It'd be like 10 to 20 grand of actual very high sophisticated cameras like they use in airports that zoom in on workers while they're working and automatically has software running that I pay subscription, no problem. I'll pay the per worker if that's what it is. If it's per hour or if it's. I don't know how they price it, but something where I can have my job guy. Chris well, put eight cameras up around the site and all that camera is going to do is run or all day. At the end of the day, it's going to say, Kyle picked up his phone. It was on his phone for a total of 171 minutes and he picked it up 78 times. Okay, so I'll assume that you were responding to employees 20% of that time and the rest you were off. And it's coming right off your pay and then it's going to be right in your terms and conditions. If you're on your phone, we use this advanced AI software. It will measure your time on your phone. You were not to use your phone, other than these narrow windows to communicate with colleagues or managers. If you are making a manager call, you send a text to update the AI app at the end of the week because we do that now with a workyard app. And that's probably been the most powerful cost saver we've had in the last 18 to 24 months. And we started doing it with these idiots downstairs that were third party 1099 doing drywall for us. And they were claiming they were here when they weren't here and we were here on the weekends, like I was. So I could figure that out. And so then as soon as people had to start punching in, what would happen is, you know, guys coming into this office in Southborough, he's punching in at, you know, like the Sturbridge exit, you know, before he's even gotten 45 minutes. And it just shows logged in. Or he's logging in at 7:08 and he's supposed to be on the job at 6 and he's rolling it back to, oh, I got here at 558. It's like, dude, the computer tells us all this Stuff, it tells us where you punched in, tells us what time you punched in. We don't need this bullshit. Now we don't do that with office staff, obviously. But the other cute game is like, oh, you know, I'm signed to 300 Bill Rick. In the construction industry, the way it works is you get to the job, you punch in, you don't come to the home office, stop over, I'm picking up a, you know, a box of nails. You know, like, okay, if you know, you need nails for the job, you pick them up at the end of the day on your way home from the, you know, shop or from the, wherever you're getting them. But you expect to have your tools be fit and ready for work, you know. So a great example would be we had this jackass, young 21 year old guy that tried to do a favor for his father. He begged us for internship, turned out to be a nightmare. But long story short is he's calling his manager saying, hey, can I stop by the office to pick up some safety gloves? It's like, no, we have safety gloves at the job site. Oh, can I stop by the office then and just clock in? It's like, that's the exact reason we don't do that. Yeah, well, it's a long drive, right? Which is why if you wear your safety glasses, you wear your helmet and you show up on time, you get an extra hundred dollars. That extra 20 bucks a day is tax free. That's for your extra gas. You know, the company's just asking for one thing in return. Be on time and work safely. We don't want you hurt. 
Speaker A: Right. 
Speaker B: And you know, some people, depending on how they're raised, they in the trade industry, they'll break their ass and work really hard for you. And you recognize those guys? I had a kid, I hired him as a pure laborer. I said, you give me 120 days as a labor. You pick up the trash on the floor, you sweep up the job site, you do whatever the fuck you're told. You carry steel tube light, you know, gauge framing materials. Upstairs, you bring them up in the elevator, do what you're told for 120 days, I'll give you a career in one of the trades. I'll let you try plumbing, I'll let you try electric, I'll let you try H Vac. You tell me what you want to do, but I'll make sure you get your apprentice hours, get you in the schooling. I'll cover the whole, whole freight. But you have to Be on time, have to wear your safety shit and you have to be respectful and work hard. That's it. And for a lot of these guys who have no formal education, that's pretty goddamn good deal. And I'll pay you market rate when you get your service certification. So long story short, I did that with this poor inner city Worcester kid that knew me through my massage therapist actually. And you know, kids father grew up in jail, you know, 25 years, never had a father. And you know, nope, no, no opportunity. Worked in a, you know, third shift, you know, warehouse, you know, 16, 18 bucks an hour, like you know, all night long. I said look, we'll start you at 21 bucks an hour. It's a career. It's not going to be Fun in the first, I could tell in 30 fucking days. In like 20 days. Hardest working kid in the room. You know what, come on over here. I think you make the most money in plumbing. Try it for a few days. Here's you're gonna work with this, the expert in the room in plumbing. Just see if you like it. Didn't even need to wait. The end of the first week every one of the high end plumbers come over. That kid, man, he's awesome. He breaks. You tell him once he learns it he's like a fucking having an apprentice, a plumber. He's already, already like dude, my job's like 10 times easier with that guy on the team. Let's keep him on the team. You know my point though is, is, is there's certain people that have it and certain that don't. And so ironically for every guy like that there's nine that you need high visibility cameras that are going to this. The phone is the number one. And so the third piece of that on that 100 bucks I didn't say is don't take your phone up during Non break hours. 9 o' clock to 9:15. If you're a tradesman, you get a broke break, you get a break from 12 to 12 30, you're out of the job by 2, 230 depending on when you start. And don't take your phone out otherwise. And you get the hundred every week and that covers your gas until a lot of these guys, that's real money, you know. But I think with the low cost of cameras today, there's got to be someone out there that solved that riddle, you know where it's just a report that I get at the end of the week a lot like my Verizon app. I have a really good Verizon app that tells me people are speeding or doing shit. I don't like for speeding. I look for, you know, the morons that the kid that's engaged at the company and he's screwing another girl in the company. I don't give a. What he's doing outside hours now. He's just using the person, the company vehicle truck for that after hours. But when he's told we have a cold snap coming on Friday, we have a meeting on Thursday morning to double check that you're closing all the valves that could freeze and flood the tenant space. And we spent six months building a law firm and we hand the guy his keys and his piece of paper on Friday. And him and his brother are already tenants across the hall and they're so excited about their new triple the size of new, brand new state of the art law firm. They're literally giddy that we've exceeded their deadline. They start moving their legal boxes in on Friday afternoon. And he leaves here at lunch, takes the company vehicle with the tracking app, drives all the way to her apartment in Worcester, stays there all afternoon, and never does the valve shut off. And on Sunday, I get a call and I find out his brand new law firm is filled with a foot of water from a frozen valve that he was supposed to close. It was one of the fucking key ones on the list. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: And so technology in that scenario, like, helps us identify people who can't be trusted with the right level of responsibility. But where we're at now with the scale, I think if we ended up having that camera system with a software system that was AI driven and said like this, this worker was your number one worker on his phone. I could sit down and say, hey, John, I like it. Here's. Here's the deal. You're now subject to leaving your phone in the truck. And if you bring it into the job site, we can't have you work here. You're just not productive either. We're gonna cut your hourly rate. We're gonna cut your pay. We did something. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: You know, right. 
Speaker A: Definitely. Okay. That, that gives more clarity. 
Speaker B: For sure. I mean, it's big numbers. It's, you know, it could be 75,000 a week of, you know, worker hours on stuff, you know, so if you can get 20% of that back in productivity, definitely, that's well worth it. Yeah. 
Speaker A: Yeah. And it improves the bottom line. 
Speaker B: Yeah. You gotta get shit done. 
Speaker A: Yeah. Most importantly. All right, so looking forward for the long term, vision and growth. Is there something you've been wanting to change about your business for a while, but you haven't had the time or resources. 
Speaker B: Yeah, more of it, what I would call user dashboard. To see the profit and loss of businesses and the customer order flow and rolling them in by business unit. So Ferris Development, each building is doing about this much monthly and gross income, you know, gross expenses, and it's sort of collecting the data and pulling it in so I can kind of see kind of which buildings are healthy, which ones are trending in the right direction and why. More in a dashboard that I could log into something and get an idea of how things are looking. Sure. I always like to say this. I can't fix problems I don't know about. And so I have to find out about the problem after it becomes a problem so big that nobody else can fix it. And that's ultimately what a CEO does. They solve the biggest problems that nobody else can solve. Everybody likes to think it's some big responsible job. It's not. It's the really shitty problems that no one else knows how to fix. You have to fix because it's your last line of defense, Right? 
Speaker A: Definitely. Okay, so as the final question, I was curious if there was one way to, to take a repetitive bottleneck that we've talked about and handle that autonomously so your team can focus on higher value work. Where would you want that applied first? 
Speaker B: Probably in the beehive business and monitoring daily work performance of staffing. Okay, that would be the first one. Just a camera idea. 
Speaker A: Sure. 
Speaker B: And then the second one would probably be in finance without throwing them all in a tizzy and reprocessing everything. More like creating a system where we had a couple of generic, for lack of a better term, bots that could, you know, take data and they could dump it in and then would land in a dashboard that kind of is assimilated. Might not be perfect, but it might spark questions and, and you know, might need fine tuning or whatever. And like right now we have what we call our quarterly forecast, which kind of like, like reforecast, which is kind of like, okay, how are we doing? But it's always rearward looking in terms of what we've done. And some of it is forward looking as what we're estimating, but it's a lot, a lot of work for the finance team. 
Speaker A: Okay, so in relation to that dashboard, would it be beneficial to have obviously projections going out, I don't know, two quarters and then also looking at the year over year for the. 
Speaker B: Exactly, yeah. Yeah. Because ultimately the goal with Beehive originally was to build something that could go public one day. And I think to do that, Martha's Vineyard's been a really good small satellite test case in the sense of it's all retail, there's no commercial. So it's a very retail, pure play. But it also says that if we can execute two hours away, then we're going to be able to execute Probably. Probably 2,000 miles away, because it's almost. You've got to make it work. Cost, you know, it's going to be cost effective to get people to that site. And so we have to aggregate orders and have enough customer flow to warrant having an office there that's 16,700amonth and stuff like that. So. So I think, like, formulatizing the Beehive brand that can be replicated in different markets is going to be important. You know what I mean? And I can't formulatize it until I start to understand the P and L from various job sets. So water replacement. The average P and L is X. The average hours it takes is Y. You know, so when we price it, we have standardized pricing. We can start to run through our proposals. Which proposals didn't get accepted. What was the average cost of the materials? What was the average cost of the job? So you can kind of start to understand what works and what doesn't before we ever send it to the customer. 
Speaker A: Definitely. 
Speaker B: Okay, so there's a lot of our proposals are getting rejected. I always hear the same thing from the salesperson, like, oh, I think we came in too high. And it's like, no, we didn't. I. It was funny. We just did it for a friend, a woman who rents in this building. She wanted to get a hot water system. And, I mean, she wanted to get a quote to do her heating system, like a new boiler, I suspect. And I think our retail rate was like 29,000. That's kind of like what it would have cost for whatever the system was that she wanted. And I said, what's our materials? And I think our materials were like, 10, 11,000. And so I said, okay, it's gonna probably take us X number of hours. I'll tell you what, take like a third off of that. Like, knock it down to like 29 to, like, just under 20 grand. Give her like, nine grand off, which keep us, like, hourly, probably doing okay, but we weren't gonna make a lot of money. But she's a tenant in our building. She's been a good referral partner, and. 
Speaker A: I want to take care of her yeah. 
Speaker B: First thing that happened is salesgirl sends it to her. She. And she goes, oh, Jennifer didn't like that quote. She wasn't expecting it to be that high. And I said, listen to the sales girl who doesn't know how any of that's going to. I said, I said, I said, like she was. No, I, I think we were really high. She was very surprised. It was almost 20,000. I said, look, Ariel's salesperson, in this case it wasn't Chris. I said, ariella, I'm telling you right now, that's a thirty thousand dollar system. I cut a third off of it to make sure we weren't going to be in a gray zone. I'm telling you, a good deal. Well, I don't know, we seem to lose a lot of deals based on price, right. This is a salesperson talking to me. And so I go, well, I go, I don't know what to tell you. Well, she's a good tenant, good referral partner. Almost like she's pushing me to give a further discount. I'm like, well whatever, it is what it is, you know, like, let her shop around, she'll find out. What do you think happens? After two weeks, she priced out with a ton of different providers she called up, she goes, I don't think they're charging me enough. I don't feel totally comfortable accepting this after seeing some of the other proposals. I'll guarantee you everyone else quoted her minimum 35 to 50 grand for that same system. Same system at 30. We would have beaten everyone. Right. I did it almost at my, almost cost. And so it was like I wasn't even trying to make anything off her. It'd be like your mom being in the jam. And you work here, you worked here, your shadow here. I. And you call me up and ask me, I try and help you. Yeah. You know what I mean? And, and if you were like, hey, this feels good, I mean, hey, that's cool, I understand. Maybe you can find some else. We'll do it cheaper, you know, like. But my point in that whole example is she literally called up her manager, Kevin, who runs that division, was like, hey, I'm kind of uncomfortable. This seems like it's way, way below market and it is because she shopped it, you know? Yeah. So like my point is, is, is I'm not about recreating the wheel. I don't want to, for lack of a better term, displace great providers that can already do great things. So if there's already great sales H vac Electric onboarding training for new H Vac techs. I just need to find it, pay the subscription fee and I'm cool with it. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: But our business, a lot of like what we're doing, I think we could template or standardize a lot and make everybody's life a lot easier. You know, our billing, we're already using stuff. I went this route, tried to, you know, create my own software for Beehive that would be managing our subscriptions, managing our billing. And I spent a pretty good amount, I don't know, 30, 50 grand, whatever I spent. And I basically flushed it all down the toilet and decided, you know, I'm sticking with Service Titan. They've already spent billions on this. Yeah. And I just need to get really good at this implementation and the sales strategy piece and I got to create, for lack of a better term, little hybrid mock up videos. And I have a really good guy downstairs that I just put, built his space for him called Go Happy who does it for like Cumberland Farm says all the videos. So I could see a hybrid where I get a couple of people to go down there, speak, take some video, put it all together and just dump it in an AI software tool that creates many, you know, montages or stories about Beehive and what we did, you know what I mean? So yeah, but I do think that's a piece of it. I do think finance, there's a lot of opportunity in these types of businesses for it, you know. Sure. 
Speaker A: Yeah. Just based off our conversation, I'm stunned. 
Speaker B: Just so you know, how many of my employees don't use it? I Almost on text 50% of the time now if it's more than a paragraph, even though I know I've got the effective message, I just want it more bulletproof, point clear to the reader. So I'll just like drop it. I'll leave my text written, copy it, put it into chat GPT, redo it, copy it, and I'll paste in where it's still highlighted. It'll just replace what I wrote. And I know people know it's AI, but you know what? It's pretty hard to not understand what the hell I'm telling you to do, you know, Definitely. 
Speaker A: No, I agree. So action items that I see that you need to implement, implement, like you said, just to reiterate is a, the first one is the cameras for Beehive, second one is the financial dashboard. 
Speaker B: Right. 
Speaker A: And the third one would be videos for Beehive for the sales and marketing. 
Speaker B: And I'm not sure I wouldn't do it in a different order. I probably do the, the videos first because it's going to lead to incremental sales revenue immediately. 
Speaker A: You know, so we would rank it videos then dashboard than the. 
Speaker B: No, I'd probably do the AI camera piece first. 
Speaker A: Okay. 
Speaker B: I'm sure that's a third party software subscription. Pretty easy solve. Sure. I would do some of the marketing videos that are going to go online. 
Speaker A: Okay. 
Speaker B: In the Google LSA model to find customers and start spending to acquire new customers to grow revenue, ramp revenue. And then third, I'd look for the dashboard piece that ties to finance if I had to prioritize it. 
Speaker A: Okay, perfect. 
Speaker B: So then can you send me a memo when you're all done? 
Speaker A: Yeah. I'm gonna send you a three page. 
Speaker B: I'd be very interested to see based on. Because I've given you some business lessons in here as well. I'd be very curious to say, have you take all the text and say summarize what this business leader said about business, but also summarize how AI could be impactful to his business or how he sees it. And then you could show me kind of like how quickly. That's easy for you to do. 
Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I could easily do that. 
Speaker B: I know that. Yeah. 
Speaker A: But no, I was planning on sending you a three page report about our conversation. So I'll definitely follow up with that. 
Speaker B: The good news is in terms of talking to us, you're still at an early stage with Beehive in the sense of like I'm not sure if you'd be a generalist to multiple companies, which sounds like at the beginning you would. But then depending on the demand, it might be a centralized key role in the revenue growth of Beehive because you're able to help systematize some things that really advance the company. And I think if we were to do that. Well, we're already doing really well. Like I just told you the numbers. I mean, 803 million to 10 to 12, that's pretty fucking good for a company 20 months in existence. 
Speaker A: Yeah. 
Speaker B: You know what I mean? 
Speaker A: Definitely. 
Speaker B: Yeah. And so it does have some legs in terms of ability to, to really grow. And in near term we gotta, for lack of a better term, clean up some of our legacy things that have been good and they helped us grow and they had predictable revenue streams like the North Carolina shopping center. It's 95% lease. I'll take that to market, I'll dump it for 55, 60 million. I already got an offer at 52 before I even really started. So that'll free up my leasing guy, Ryan. It'll free up Eric and to start doing other leasing initiatives that are important, you know? 
Speaker A: Definitely. 
Speaker B: Yeah. 
Speaker A: Okay, great. 
Speaker B: Yeah. 
Speaker A: Well, that's it for the meeting. 
Speaker B: Yeah. 


Ferris Overview 2
Meeting Title: Pt 2 Ferris Overview
Date: Feb 18 - 3:30-4:15pm
Current Growth Bottlenecks
* Marketing & Advertising Operations
   * Getting ads online takes 10 steps when should be 3
   * Process involves: video creation → LSA account approval → content writing
   * Targeted, timely marketing biggest opportunity (weather-based emergency plumbing campaigns)
   * AI could dramatically speed up content creation for specific campaigns
* Space Planning & Leasing
   * IRS vacating space - opportunity to split into 3-5 suites
   * Current process: architect takes days for basic layouts
   * ChatGPT could generate retail floor plans in 3 minutes vs days
   * Cowork space example: marking units “Reserved” took too long, should be 5-minute AI task
* Regulatory Navigation
   * National Grid feeder study: 4-6 months → need to cut to 4-6 weeks
   * Strategy: mayor letter, economic development zone priority, align with Governor Healy housing initiatives
   * Currently piecing together action plan manually
Employee Productivity & Monitoring
* Phone Usage Problem
   * Biggest productivity drain across construction/trades teams
   * Example: worker on phone 171 minutes, picked up 78 times in one day
   * Current solution: $100/week bonus for safety compliance + no phone use during work hours
* Proposed AI Camera Solution
   * Airport-style sophisticated cameras with AI software
   * Automatic tracking: phone usage time, pickup frequency, productivity metrics
   * Weekly reports similar to Verizon tracking app
   * Estimated cost: $10-20k investment for massive ROI on $75k/week in worker hours
* Success Story
   * WorkYard app implementation saved significant costs
   * Caught time theft: workers claiming hours when not on site
   * GPS tracking prevents false clock-ins
Financial Reporting & Dashboard Needs
* Current Gaps
   * No automated P&L generation from project cost data
   * Can’t quickly analyze cost per square foot across projects
   * Finance team manually creates quarterly forecasts (backward-looking)

   * Monthly gross income/expenses by property
   * Forward-looking projections (2 quarters out)
   * Year-over-year comparisons
   * Automated data ingestion from spreadsheet dumps
* Business Impact
   * Better pricing for third-party services based on actual cost data
   * Example: 50k sq ft storage building could be profitable at near-zero equipment cost to consumer
