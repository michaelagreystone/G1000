Speaker A: So good to meet everybody. I'm Danny. I work at the Fallon Company. We're a real estate development firm based in Boston. We have offices in Charlotte, Nashville and Boston. And I don't know if you guys are familiar with the Seaport and, you know, different submarkets of Boston, but our company developed Fanpier, which is a large project on the waterfront in Seaport. It includes three residential buildings, one of which is under construction right now. If you come to Seaport, it's a big, really cool kind of. It's got a different vibe to it than the other buildings in Seaport. It's got like a white facade. It's going up right next to Fan Pier park next to the marina. So you guys might see that if you're walking around Seaport. But anyway, we've done, you know, several billion dollars worth of development work in Boston. We built Massmutual's campus in Boston. We built Vertex Pharmaceuticals Global Headquarters, multiple other office buildings, the Westin Waterfront Hotel, the Convention Center Hotel. And we're also doing some really large projects in Charlotte and Nashville. We generally like to do larger scale mixed use projects. So that's. Instead of doing like an infill project where we just develop one building, we usually like to take, you know, take control over multiple acres and do something that is phased, where we're building multiple buildings over many years and kind of creating a neighborhood. And we can talk more about the, the benefits and drawbacks of that. But there's a lot I could say about the development business. Business, it's a very tricky business because it involves many different disciplines. And every project kind of takes on a life of its own. We start out by evaluating a site and trying to acquire a site. So we're kind of negotiating a deal up front, trying to get site control, and we're simultaneously putting together a business plan that we think is the right business plan that's best for that particular site. After we get site control and we compete to win the. To win the deal, it depends on who owns the land. That can take a variety of forms. But once we get site control, we then go through a process where we try to execute on that business plan and we refine that business plan as time goes on. So in Boston, for instance, when we did Fan Pier, we were trying to figure out, you know, what building would go first. Would it be an office building, would it be a residential building, would it be a hotel? And so then at that point, you kind of figure out how you're going to phase the project and you start working with an architect to design the project, to get the project permitted, which in every market is very different. In Boston, it's extremely, extremely difficult to get a project permitted in Nashville. In Charlotte it's a lot easier. They're more pro development in those markets than they are in Boston. So you get the project permitted and then once it's permitted, you've got a fully designed, fully permitted project. Now you can go out and try to get a bank to lend you a ton of money and bring on an equity investor. Usually we work with large institutional equity investors. It could be a pension fund, it could be a life insurance company, it could be a sovereign wealth fund, it could be a private equity firm. But anyway, we need to raise a lot of capital to start construction. We build the building, we stabilize it, which means like leasing it up, right? So if it's an office building, it needs to be fully leased. If it's a residential building, fully sold or fully leased, and then we exit the investment, we usually sell it. Right now we're building condos. So we'll sell the condos as we're, as we're delivering them. But usually we build for rent apartment buildings or office buildings which need to get stabilized, or hotels which need to get stabilized. And then we sell the asset. And when we sell it, we pay off the debt, our equity investors make their return and we capture a large portion of the upside. That's if everything goes well. That's kind of the revenue model for real estate development. You, you can also hold it long term. But if you hold an asset like that, the problem is you need a large capital event to pay off your investors and your debt. So usually you'll refinance it into a more accretive long term financing strategy or you'll sell. So if we were to hold it, that would be like a build to core model. We're usually build, stabilize, sell. So that's the quick overview. We've got like about $6 billion of development on our pipeline, including an enormous project in Nashville that's over 30 acres and 17 buildings. We've got a 17 acre site in Charlotte, We've got multiple projects in Boston in our pipeline. We're under construction right now on two projects. We're looking to break ground on another one next month and that one's in Charlotte. And we're also looking at new deals. So while we're also managing that pipeline of existing assets or assets that were, that are under construction or that we're prepping for construction, we also have to find new deals and fill out our pipeline. So we kind of have these various different verticals to our business. We've got people that are involved on the investment side, which is largely where I sit. But I also do a lot of the corporate stuff for us, including technology integration. So it's a. It's a timely conversation. So we've got the investments vertical that deals with sourcing new projects, figuring out the business plan for those projects, and then once a project is delivered and operating, dealing with the disposition of that asset or the refinancing of that asset. So you kind of. That investments team kind of governs the business plan at the front end and the sale at the back end of a project. You then have a development vertical, which are the people that manage the permitting process and the architects and engineering teams. So once the investment team secures a project, the development team is kind of the lead for executing the business plan, but they're tethered to the investments team because they need to make sure that that business plan is. Is being executed correctly. Right. You can't. You don't want the development team to be completely divorced from the investments team, because then when you hand them a business plan for a project, you say, hey, we acquired this site. You need to execute. If they just go off in a silo and do their thing, you risk there being this siloing of information between the original business plan, which is the. Which is what works. Right. From an economics perspective, what we believe works, that development team needs to understand what they're executing on. And if there's refinements to that business plan, There needs to be a lot of communication between the investments people and the development people. And then once. Once we get a project under construction, the develop. The investments team will work with the development team leading up to that to get financing for the project, to get debt and equity for the construction. Once it's under construction. We have a construction vertical as well, and those folks manage the general contractor. So we hire a general contractor like Turner Construction or, you know, we've worked with other firms as well. In Charlotte, we're working with a few different firms on our various projects, but we hire a general contractor that has a whole team of people managing the construction with subcontractors underneath them. But we have folks internally that manage that general contractor. And so there's a lot going on at various points in the deal cycle. You have completely different disciplines involved, and these projects take multiple years, sometimes decades to complete. That's. That's the quick overview. I've been with the firm about 10 years. I've been involved in pretty much each component of that cycle that I just mentioned to you, but very much focused on the investment side and also kind of overall corporate strategy for the firm. Yeah, we have a quick question based off of that. 
Speaker B: Hi, can you hear me? Hi, can you hear me? 
Speaker A: Yeah, I can hear you. 
Speaker B: So I had two questions. The first one, you spoke about a lot of the in house activities and how some of them could be outsourced, might be outsourced. So I just want to get a clear idea on what exactly you do in house and what exactly you get outsourced. 
Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. So in we the development business is largely a business of managing risk. And what I mean by that a lot of the time, like for example, designing a building, having an architect design a building, that's not something that developers take on internally. We outsource design, but we guide them. Right. So we're explaining when we work with an architect, we tell them these are the parameters we're trying to achieve for the project and they propose different designs and we work collaboratively with them to whittle that down to the desired design and the desired budget. So internally we're a very lean team. We only have about 18 people at the company and it's billions of dollars worth of development. So that gives you a sense for how much we're outsourcing. The thing that we, I would say our core competency is really, really lies in the business planning piece, right? It's picking the right markets, picking the right sites, figuring out how to make a deal work to actually negotiate a deal, to get a project under contract. So it's basically like setting up the business plan for any project. So the financial analytics, the sourcing of investment opportunities, the negotiation of investment opportunities is all in house. But at each stage in the development process we're usually relying heavily on external consultants. I'll give you an example. When we lease a building, we're not doing the leasing ourselves. We hire brokers that do the leasing. But when we go to find sites up front to try to develop, to try to find an investment opportunity for a new site, we're going to be working different relationships in the market, brokers, landowners, politicians, etc to try to get more embedded in the market. But that's something that fundamentally we are doing. We're generating the deals, we're underwriting the deals, we're coming up with the business plans and we're, and we're then kind of quarterbacking Assembling a team to execute. But we don't have engineers in house, we don't have architects in house. We don't have a construction team in house. We have people that manage those teams externally. But the crux of our business is developing business plans that we think are smart arbitrage opportunities or just overall irreplaceable real estate that we think we have an angle where we can get site control and execute in the way other companies can. So our ability to be deal makers and develop sound business plans are really the key core competencies of the business that allow us to separate ourselves from the competition. 
Speaker B: I have one more question, and I had another question. So your current model is build, stabilize, sell. And I was just wondering what your opinion on real estate investment trusts are because you're getting on big institutional investors, equity partners. So I was wondering why not, why wouldn't you consider holding the asset, maybe listing it under a REIT and having it grow that way? 
Speaker A: That's a great question. I'm candidly not an expert on REITs. I know they have a whole different model because they rely on like, I think they, the, the, the statistic, the data metric that they solve for is funds from operations, if I remember correctly, like ffo, I think it's shortened to. So they're heavily relying on just existing cash flow. Right. And I think REITs also, a lot of these companies are vertically integrated, right? So like some of the, some of the bigger real estate firms generate a lot of money through fees. So, and that, and that actually relates to my previous answer too. Like Boston Properties, for instance, is a reit, right? BXP is what they're called now. They have leasing in house. They probably have property management in house. Right? So when they own a building, they're making money on the leasing, they're making money on the property management. Right. And a lot of other companies have a similar model, so they're, they're more vertically integrated so they can capture revenue in different ways. Our firm is truly a developer. And when you look at, if you were to Google this, like we're a merchant developer, which is effectively the model I mentioned, which is, you know, finance construct, stabilize, sell. And a big reason we do that is because with our cost of capital, it makes more sense for our, for us to get in and out of deals and recycle that capital in new deals, because we're not a fee machine. We don't have leasing or property management in house, so we're not able to generate fees in other ways. I will say there is, there is one fee that we tend to charge which is when we're under, when we, when we bring on a lender and an institutional equity partner to finance a deal and we're under construction on it, we charge a developer fee. So that's built into our budget. That's effectively like a keep the lights on fee, if you will. Like that is to pay for our staff and overhead to execute the project and manage it. But we really make our money on the back end when we sell it and we get our investors their money, their return and we get into the promote. Right? It's the same model as venture capital. It's a private equity model, right. It's a waterfall structure with a limited partner. We're the GP, we bring on an LP, we have a waterfall, we get them to their two point, whatever equity multiple and they're 20 IRR. And then over that we make a huge percentage of the, of the profits. In theory, right? That is the model a lot has to go, right, And I'm oversimplifying it, but there's a waterfall structure with an lp. So that model requires you sell and make the duration of the investment as short as possible because those are IRR based metrics in the waterfall. So it's based on the fundamental thesis that we're trying to exit this as fast as possible and get you to your, to your equity multiple and your IRR as quickly as possible. So we get into the promote and then we can move on to the next deal. That's kind of the crux of how the business works. It's different from some other investors that might be more long term holders who have a lot of fee engines within their company and they have a property management arm, they have a leasing arm. They may have a completely different model where they refinance when they build it, pay off the investor, their return and then they stay in the deal and just charge a bunch of fees and hold it long term. It all comes down to the source of your capital and the timeline associated with that capital. Our capital needs to, needs to get in and out. 
Speaker C: Hey Danny, this is Yash here. Thank you for your time. I guess I have a question on just the whole research process and on your side, investment side, how you guys figure out how to pick the right market, how to figure out the business plan for that development and just love to understand what the workflow of that process is and what are the key challenges to getting the right data for these new markets. Say you're going to rally Or Nashville. Like, what are like the most difficult steps when trying to figure out that business plan? 
Speaker A: Such a good question. It's honestly, I wish I had a better answer for it. I would say there's like, you see your name's Yash. Yeah. I would say there's a couple layers to it, Yash. There's the, what I would call macro, geography, selection, and then there's like the micro. Right. 
Speaker D: And. 
Speaker A: What I mean by that is the exercise to select a market is a different exercise than selecting a site or going after a site. So I think at a certain point, this is kind of an art more than it is a science. But you know, what we, what we did as a company is we looked at the universe of markets in the country, in the U.S. and we said to ourselves, there's certain kind of gating variables, right. We're not, we're based in Boston. We started in Boston, Right. I was here when we were just in Boston. And we decided to move into Charlotte, Raleigh and Nashville. And part of what drove that is geographically we wanted to stay on the East Coast. That was just a constraint we gave ourselves. So from there it's like, okay, what else do we want to look for? We want environments that are politically, politically healthy for development, right. When I say that there's a lot of markets where I would be concerned based on the political environment to go try to do, to operate a development business. Business, right? Like pick your town, right? You got. We're in Massachusetts, right? If you wanted to start a development business based out of Brookline, Massachusetts, and just develop in Brookline, you'd have a hard time, right? Because there's a lot of forces that are against development in a town like Brookline. So the same thing applies for, you know, selecting a state or a city to operate in. You want to select areas that generally speaking, or you can execute the business, right. Boston's becoming more difficult. It's. Some people would argue that actually makes it a better market to invest in though. So that's, it's a nuanced answer because when it's harder politically to get projects done, you can actually. There's more scarcity of great sites, right? So if you're able to execute, you have now you have a more scarce resource, so you've actually created a potential competitive advantage. So in Boston, we've experienced that where out of town developers coming into Boston have no chances. It's really hard to succeed. Right. But for us looking into new markets, we wanted markets that had pro development, pro business environments where Businesses were moving to where people were moving to that had strong job growth in industries that we felt like were going to stand the test of time, you know, high educational attainment and where we felt like there was a strong opportunity to, you know, generate the returns that we need to be successful. So we identified those markets because all of them have that in different capacities. Another thing we look for, Yash, is infrastructure so good. Airports, you know, transportation infrastructure, basically anything that a city needs. Like having the bones that allow it to grow. Yeah. Both geographically and economically. So all those cities have their benefits to them, they all have their drawbacks. But we felt like they were on the, they were well positioned for growth over the next, you know, 15 to 20 years for all those different reasons I just mentioned. So that's kind of like the macro level. There's other markets that are great for that too. Right. Like Florida would have been a great, like if you pick Miami 10 years ago, like you would, it would have been a home run. Yeah. So people are moving there. High educational attainment, jobs are moving, their political environment that back, that generally is accepting of development are all factors, I'd say. Then once you look at the market, you now need to identify, okay, how are we going to go about securing sites that we like? And so then you get into like, okay, what sub markets do we like? And when you talk about sub markets, some sub markets are residential. Like if you were to look at the Boston market, for example, for instance, if you looked at like Waltham, the great example, if you have a good 2 acre site and you can build a multi family project in Waltham, it's going to get leased up. Right. People want to live in Waltham. If you try to build, build a big hotel in Waltham, that might not work. Right. Or if you were to do a big mixed use project in Waltham, it might work. You'd have to really understand is that the sub market that you want to hit your wagon to. And so again, more of an art than a science, but part of it is what's the precedent? Right. Where are jobs moving to, where are people moving to, where are the highest earning people moving to within that geography? And all of that plays into it. And it depends on what type of program you're trying to do. If you're trying to do all residential play, if you're trying to do a mixed use project for us, these bigger mixed use projects that involve office, hotel resi, you kind of need to do them within the, they kind of need to be in the best sub Markets that are within proximity to the urban core, right? You can't really do. It's hard to do that in a random suburb unless you have extremely good market data, like around here. Yash, you see stuff that's happened in like Marlborough, you've seen stuff that's happened in like Beverly, you know, Watertown. There are examples of great mixed use projects that aren't in like Boston or Cambridge. But you've got to do your homework to know that that's where the jobs are. Employers want to be there and people want to be there. So I think it's really as simple as that. Do employers want to be there and do people want to be there? And that can sometimes be a chicken or the egg, right? Sometimes people wanting to be somewhere makes employers want to be there. And the reverse is true as well, right? You want to move somewhere where there's jobs. So again, a little bit of an art, but I think in terms of data points, you have to look at those factors, right? Where, where's the population moving and where are the jobs moving and where are the jobs that we believe are the jobs that will stand the test of time, right? As the economy evolves over time, you don't want to be in like Detroit when the auto industry goes away, right? You want to, you want to, you want to get in front of industries that are growing. And so partly Raleigh, those are great, like Raleigh, Nashville, Charlotte, you know, there's Raleigh in particular has a lot of like high tech, medical, right? That sort of stuff. Biotech, a lot of really great engineering schools. So another thing to look at is college pipeline talent, right? Where are people getting the degrees? Where there's talent that we think aligns to the industries that are the future. So that's another big piece. And where are students moving to? Right? Like Miami is a good example where there may not be that many schools in Miami proper, but it's a city that will attract people to it. Kind of like New York is same idea, right? People will move to New York from all over the country. San Francisco, same thing. So there's a lot to unpack with your question. And then when you look at actually going after sites now, you're like, you're like, I would say like there's three levels, right? There's like geography, macro level, there's some market, then there's like, how do we actually go find a site? That comes down to knowing brokers, right? Because the brokers control the deal flow. So fundamentally they are the gatekeepers of the deal flow. So you have to be in front of all the brokers and then think of any other person that might be a gatekeeper of land. Right? It could be, you know, in some cases it's actually governments, municipalities. Right? Like around here, the MBTA has their whole program where they're trying to develop MBTA owned sites throughout Massachusetts. So like in that sense, government or quasi government agencies can be gatekeepers of great real estate. The landowners directly. Right. Knowing other developers, knowing other landowners, being connected in the community, in the chamber of commerce for, you know, being on boards, things like that, being involved in the community so that you, you are connected to people who control land. Again, that is very much just salesmanship, deal making 101. But like you have to be in the room as much as possible with as much of the gatekeepers of land. And that starts with brokers. But it can, but it can, it's, it's a wider net than people realize. Thank you. 
Speaker C: And just a quick follow up. Would you say that when you get all this data on all these variables, is there more research space like you know, going online, like trying to find the right data and reports, or is it more talking to people on the ground and getting a picture of the scene over there? 
Speaker A: It's a great question. I think the first part is the online research, which I think helps, it helps give you parameters and understand like, you know, order of magnitude where the job growth is, what stuff like, like how's, what's the breakdown of the economy, where are people moving, things like that. But when you get into like finding sites and getting very sharpening your pencil on the underwriting or business plan for any given opportunity, you have to get information from people on the ground in real time. Because if you rely on data online, you're never going to get up to date information like we're working on a deal right now. We're talking to brokers in the market who are signing leases with office users in Charlotte right now. And those data points are so much different than the data points that I'd be able to find online. Everything online would be so far antiquated that it would actually hinder my ability to make a sound decision. So for deal specific things like what should I pay for the land, what should the lease be, what should my financing assumptions be? What do I need to get for a pre lease to attract a lender? What do I need to, what type of returns do I need to hit to attract an institutional equity partner? I'm not going to be able to find that online. It's happening too fast. Thank you. Yep. Awesome. 
Speaker D: Hey, Danny, my name's Cole. Thanks again for coming in. I know that part of this class here is understanding the small business owner as well as the implementation, understand the AI piece. Right. And I know that you talked a little bit like, oh my gosh, trying to implement AI to our company and kind of just want to steer the direction towards that of if you could have a magic wand that could create something or solve a problem that's happening in your company right now, what would that solution entail in terms of AI or some tech that you don't know of as of now? 
Speaker A: It's a great question. So I think there's so many different areas where I could, where I could see AI working and we're already using it. We're using it in various capacities right now. One of them right out of the gate is, to Yash's point, actually, if I'm putting together a business plan for a site, we have these really complex financial models that have 100 inputs in them for the AI to be able to, we're using Claude actually right now to review our models, but to be able to come up with a model from scratch and optimize our models and get us 90% of the data in it or 100% of the data and then we check it. Right. And fill it in with what we think is right. It just seems so obvious that you'd start there. I like, give me a financial model for a mixed use project that starts with a hotel, then a residential building, then an office building. I need a full pro forma that ties together that, you know, we, you know, you can give it a, you can prompt it to do what you need to do and then checking it on the back end. That's one example. I could see another example where you're using data to identify acquisition opportunities based on criteria that you give it. So give me all of the sites in the Raleigh Durham market that are, you know, over three acres within X miles of a highway, that are, you know, owned privately, that, you know, are in these municipalities and give me the phone numbers of all the owners of those properties. Right. Like some sort of, some sort of deal sourcing bot that helps you find the best sites quickly and maybe does some of the outreach for you. Like, I know sales people are doing that all over the country right now, right. Like they've got Claude running their whole sales operation basically. So like that is there, is that, that fundamentally the business development side of our job is a sales job, but you're kind of coming at it from a more nuanced approach. You're not selling a product, but you're like, hey, I work for the Fallon Company. I want to potentially look at your site to develop it. Like, would you be open to chatting? Like, doing that with AI would be way more efficient for sure. And how we do it currently, I think using AI to review designs or even generate designs is kind of a 2.0 thing. I mean, we're already using it to do renderings and give us basic massings and stuff. Because a lot of the times when we're doing presentations, we have to go to the architect to generate imagery for us and collateral for us to pitch stuff to investors or tenants. And now we're starting to realize we can do it better internally using AI. Yep, they generate amazing imagery super quickly. 
Speaker D: It's insane how fast the technology has been moving. 
Speaker A: Yeah. And it saves us hundreds of thousands. We did one, we responded to an RFI two weeks ago of a tenant in the, in the market that was an office user. And instead of having to go to our architect, we did it in like five days. And it's like the. One of the best responses we've ever put together. And it was like, the renderings are insane because we don't have the project designed yet. So we didn't really have much to show them. And we ended up coming up with an awesome concept using AI. 
Speaker D: Yeah, it's been crazy. I know we're short on time here too. I'm just going to follow up with two more questions that. Okay, I'm going to follow up to the one we stated beforehand in terms of those AI processes that we're talking about and what you could possibly create with that magic wand. Right. So in terms of creating the financial models, the details, deal flow, do you think the problems behind using those is. 
Speaker A: Cole, can I pause you? One other one would be negotiating contracts. Okay. Because we have so many historical contracts though, just to give you an idea of how much of a pain in the ass this is for us. We have so many historical contracts. All we're doing is managing contracts. We've got an architect, got a construction company, we have a loan agreement, we have a joint venture agreement, a. I mean, it's hundreds, millions of dollars of legal bills to negotiate contracts on any given project. They're hundred page mega documents that are our lawyers redlined for us. And we go back and forth, lawyer to lawyer. It takes forever. It's super painful. Gosh, it'd be nice if an AI could do that for us. 
Speaker D: Great, great. 
Speaker A: Okay. 
Speaker D: And that kind of feeds into my next question. Do you think the problems with that to create these solutions comes down to being open versus closed environments? Meaning that privacy and security for your materials or even the data aggregation, like do you have all the data in order for this to be trained on, to be worked on and then moving into that open or closed source problem. 
Speaker A: I don't. I might not be fully appreciating the nuance of open or closed voice, but my sense is we most of the. So maybe I'll answer in different parts. The aspect of all underwriting deals and doing financial models requires going out and finding information that's online. So in that sense it's open, right? Yep, yep. Negotiating documents that are that where we have precedent documents to reference that could be something that's closed. Because the AI doesn't need to go online to figure out what our loan agreement should look like. If they could just reference the last four loans we did to help us negotiate a new loan agreement without reinventing the wheel. My sense is a lot of it is open because a lot of it is pulling best practices or pulling data from the, from, from the web from the web at any given point in time versus relying on data that we've already collected internally. That's not something that we do and we're definitely not very good at aggregating it. 
Speaker D: Okay, sounds good. 
Speaker A: Maybe there's a two. Maybe there's a two step process where we'd aggregate the data and then have the models run off of that data. So maybe that's. I don't know if that's even possible, but that almost feels like two steps, like bring the data in, how's it? And then have the bot or the modeling itself work off the data that you've already aggregated. That's one way to tackle it. Or you could have the AI go straight to the web. 
Speaker D: Okay, sounds good. Yeah, definitely possible. I think we've got one more question here. 
Speaker E: What's up, Danny? Thank you for talking. 
Speaker A: Talking to us. This is kind of two parter. 
Speaker E: Before you were talking about the different verticals and the amount of interaction that just happens between them on a day to day basis. So for you specifically, from like investment to development, are there really ways of tracking success or failure from your internal processes? And are there any processes or systems or any of these interactions between the verticals that have kind of been involved with project setbacks or failures or different things that have just fell through the cracks in the past? 
Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. Great. What's your, what was your name man? 
Speaker E: I'm Eli. 
Speaker A: Eli. It's a good question. And so I, it's a sore spot actually. The reason I alluded the beginning, I alluded to the, the importance of communication between each of the verticals of the company. And you see this at any business, right? But in development in particular, once we get a project under contract and we have a business plan that's been approved by, we have an investment committee internally, right. There's so much that goes into approving that business plan. Think of it as almost like you're trying to prove out starting a business from scratch with a group of investors. You're like getting the investors to commit to the plan, right? And then when you hand that over to the development team, it can take so many twists and turns and it's like a multi year process of getting it approved, getting it designed. So much can change. And I'll give you a really great example, Eli. When we're looking at deals in like 2018, you can imagine that what we considered to be a sound business plan in 2018, the goal post moves constantly on what it means for a business plan to be a sound business plan. It's like starting a software company in 2018 if I'm still working on that same software company today. Obviously the goal, the goal post has moved because I now need to, I now need to adjust for AI and what that and what that means and other changes in the market. I need to adjust for my investors return expectations. So that's, that's exactly what happened in real estate. We, we underwrote deals in like 2018, 2019 covet hit, right. So we had deals that we thought worked based on a set of parameters and many parameters changed. After Covid, for example, office became very difficult to get financed. Interest rates plummeted and then they shot up. So the cost of capital went up. So investors return thresholds went up a lot. So we had projects that would have worked and would have attracted equity and debt in like 2022 when, when or 2021 when interest rates were super low because risk free money was so low, right. It was like you could borrow for nothing. So we could post a return that was a pretty modest return and it was still very attractive to investors when interest rates came up and the risk free rate came up so much. Now we had to create additional, we had to have an additional premium over that with our investments to attract equity and debt. So the goalpost moved on us. So that's a great example of if we're on top of those type of data points the entire time as that project is advancing, the investments team and the development team are constantly in communication, and the investments team is getting appropriate information that's telling us, guys, be on high alert right now. Those in those returns that you projected 18 months ago are now 100 basis points below where they need to be to make this project work. That could have saved us a lot of headache because we had. And we. I think we did a good job honestly, like, because we had to adapt on the fly to take projects that we were targeting a certain return. We had to adapt on the fly to make them more profitable, to be able to execute them in 2025, 2026, which in a lot of ways meant a more challenging environment to raise debt and equity. We just had to work harder to raise debt and equity. It was a thinner pool of capital, and that was. Except that was interested in those deals and we got. It was more challenging for us to execute with those lenders and equity partners because they had more leverage. Right. If we had. If we had negotiated those deals four years ago, we would have gotten better terms because the return requirements were lower. So that's one key variable is return requirements that investors and lenders have that the investments team needs to be constantly aware of, and that needs to then trickle its way to the development team. And the best way for me to explain that in a broader sense is the business plan that you put together at the very beginning that gets approved by your investment committee. Think of it as a founder of a company going to their venture capital backers and getting an approval for seed funding. Right. Every so often you have to go back and revisit that business plan. Yeah. And that business plan needs to be able to evolve in a very proactive way to adapt to the changing market circumstances. And that changing markets, those changing market circumstances can take a variety of forms. It can take the form of what are construction costs doing? Is it. Is there an inflationary environment? What are. What are rents doing? Are rents going down? What are sale price? What are sales doing? Are prices going up or down? What are banks doing? What are equity partners doing? Do they want to invest in more projects or are they retreating from development? Right. Like, there's all of these variables that are informing what a sound business plan looks like. So you need to be able to adapt the business plan constantly. And that needs to involve the investments team getting the information quickly and then immediately going to the development team to refine the business plan and adjust accordingly. Yeah. So if there's a gap in communication, it fails. Or if there's a, if there's a gap in data and the investments team's not getting the data that then informs the business plan, you will also fail there. So you got to get the information, you got to get it quickly and then you have to communicate to the development team and get the business plan to be updated. Cool. 
Speaker E: Thank you. 
Speaker C: That was a great analogy. 
Speaker A: Appreciate you, Danny, for coming. Coming in. Thank you so much. And we'll be following up with some of our insights and potential recommendations. Anytime, guys. By the way, before we leave, we have a program like I, I, I, I can't leave this call without telling you guys. We do a real estate program in the summer at my company that we run. Myself and a few colleagues teach it. So if anybody's interested in real estate, it's a free program at six weeks. It's actually five weeks this summer. Two days a week, 5 to 7pm or 6 to 8pm Two days a week for five weeks on real estate investing. So if anybody's interested, you guys could share my contact information and follow up. Amazing. 
Speaker F: Yeah, we can put that in the classroom. Thanks, Danny. Oh man, I didn't see you. Yeah, no, I was in the other room with the other business owner. But Professor Noyes also wanted to offer you three seats to the G1000AI Boot Camp for SMEs in April. We have two slots, April 10 and April 17. I can send you the link, but yeah, he's offering three comp seats if you guys want to come out to Babson and get really nitty gritty seeing what students can do and also, you know, award winning professors kind of doing upskilling for business owners. 
Speaker A: So yeah, that would be fantastic. I really appreciate it, guys. Yeah, send me that info, Spencer. 
Speaker F: Yeah, I love to forward it all through. And we'll post your program in the classroom and in the WhatsApp for our class as well. 
Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you guys so much. Love what you're doing. All right, have a good one, guys. 
Speaker F: All right, guys, you basically have until like 5:10. I know it's tight, but you can get your coffee, you can get your food if you take a longer break.
