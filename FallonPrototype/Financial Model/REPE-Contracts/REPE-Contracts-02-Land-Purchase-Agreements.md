## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Land purchase agreements in the real estate private equity context are far more complex than standard residential contracts. Because raw land carries entitlement, environmental, and development risk that does not exist with an income-producing asset, PSAs (purchase and sale agreements) for land are heavily negotiated instruments that allocate these risks between buyer and seller. The buyer's goal is to control land at a fixed price while spending the minimum upfront capital to conduct due diligence and obtain approvals. The seller's goal is to extract maximum value while remaining protected against a buyer who ties up land indefinitely with no obligation to close.

## Earnest Money Provisions

Earnest money (also called the "deposit") is the buyer's initial at-risk capital that signals seriousness of intent and compensates the seller if the buyer fails to close. In land PSAs, earnest money structures are significantly more nuanced than in residential transactions.

Most commercial land PSAs structure the earnest money in two phases: a refundable deposit during the due diligence period and a non-refundable deposit (or "hard money") once due diligence has concluded and the buyer elects to proceed. The refundable deposit is typically smaller — often representing 1-3% of the purchase price — and provides the buyer a free look window to conduct initial analysis. At the end of the due diligence period, if the buyer does not terminate, the deposit "goes hard" — meaning it becomes non-refundable — and often increases in amount.

Some transactions require the deposit to go hard in tranches. For example, 50% of the initial deposit goes hard at the end of due diligence, the remaining 50% goes hard when entitlements are approved, and an additional deposit is made at each subsequent milestone. This structure aligns risk with progress: the buyer has more capital at risk as they achieve milestones that reduce overall project risk.

Negotiation points include: the size and timing of deposits; whether any portion of the deposit is refundable if the seller defaults; whether earnest money is applied toward the purchase price at closing; and whether the buyer can obtain extensions by making additional hard money payments. Sellers of high-demand sites may require substantial non-refundable deposits from the outset to deter speculative buyers.

The earnest money remedy is also heavily negotiated. Most land PSAs provide that the earnest money represents liquidated damages and is the seller's sole remedy for buyer default — the seller cannot sue for specific performance. Sellers of irreplaceable or unique sites may resist this limitation and insist on retaining specific performance rights, particularly where the land is being sold as part of a larger portfolio and price certainty matters more than individual deal remedy.

Hold periods for earnest money in escrow also matter. In long-duration land deals with phased closings, the seller may negotiate for the deposit to be released from escrow to the seller at specified milestones, rather than held in escrow through the entire closing period. Buyers resist this because a released deposit is much harder to recover if the seller defaults.

## Due Diligence Periods

The due diligence period gives the buyer a contractual right to investigate all aspects of the property and terminate the contract without cause (and with full refund of the deposit) within the specified window. For land, due diligence periods are substantially longer than for income-producing properties because the buyer must investigate not only physical and title conditions but also entitlement feasibility, infrastructure capacity, environmental conditions, and market studies.

Standard due diligence periods for land in institutional transactions range from 60 to 180 days, with extension options available at the buyer's election (typically by paying additional hard money or an extension fee to the seller). Complex transactions involving environmental remediation, difficult entitlements, or phased development programs may require 12-24 month due diligence windows.

Due diligence in land transactions typically covers: (1) title examination and survey, including review of recorded easements, covenants, and encumbrances; (2) environmental phase I and II assessments, and if contamination is detected, phase III remediation analysis; (3) geotechnical investigation including soil bearing capacity, expansive soils, and fill conditions; (4) wetlands delineation and Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional determination; (5) flood plain analysis and FEMA mapping review; (6) utilities assessment including availability, capacity, and extension costs for water, sewer, gas, electric, and telecommunications; (7) entitlement feasibility review including pre-application meetings with planning staff, review of applicable zoning codes, general or comprehensive plan designations, and overlay districts; (8) traffic impact analysis; and (9) endangered species habitat assessment.

The buyer's right to terminate during due diligence is typically unconditional — meaning the buyer need not state a reason for termination. This is the "free look" protection. If the buyer terminates in a timely fashion, all deposits are returned and neither party has further obligation. If the buyer fails to terminate before the deadline, the deposit goes hard automatically (by operation of the contract, not by any affirmative action required), which is a critical drafting point that protects sellers against buyers who miss deadlines unintentionally.

Sellers who have conducted extensive pre-sale due diligence may push for shorter buyer due diligence periods, backed by a "data room" of pre-existing reports. Buyers should review seller-provided due diligence carefully and understand that the representations and warranties in the PSA — not the due diligence reports — govern the seller's liability for conditions discovered post-closing that are inconsistent with what the reports showed.

## Environmental Contingencies

Environmental risk is one of the most significant concerns in land acquisition. An environmental contingency allows the buyer to terminate if environmental investigations reveal conditions that would make the project economically infeasible or legally untenable, even after the general due diligence period has closed.

Standard environmental contingencies define the triggering condition as discovery of contamination requiring remediation whose estimated cost exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., $500,000 or 3% of purchase price). The contingency period runs from completion of Phase II investigation, not from signing of the PSA, which gives the buyer adequate time to receive environmental consultant reports.

More protective environmental provisions allow the buyer to terminate based on the mere existence of contamination, regardless of cost, or based on discovery of protected species, wetlands, or other conditions that would trigger permitting delays. Sellers resist open-ended environmental termination rights and typically negotiate a "materiality" standard and a cap on the buyer's right to terminate for environmental reasons beyond the general due diligence window.

Where contamination is known or suspected, PSAs often include seller remediation obligations, price reductions tied to remediation cost estimates, and escrow arrangements where the seller deposits remediation funds at closing. Some transactions include post-closing environmental indemnities from the seller, though sophisticated institutional sellers resist open-ended indemnity obligations and prefer to cap environmental liability at the purchase price.

Buyers should be aware that "as-is" provisions in land PSAs, while standard, do not necessarily eliminate the seller's liability for fraudulent concealment or affirmative misrepresentation of known environmental conditions. A seller who knows of contamination and affirmatively conceals it — by refusing access to areas of the property, removing visible indicators, or making false representations in the PSA — may face post-closing liability even under an "as-is" contract. Buyers should conduct environmental due diligence as if the "as-is" provision fully applies, and should not rely on seller representations as a substitute for independent investigation.

## Entitlement Contingencies

An entitlement contingency makes the buyer's obligation to close conditional on the property receiving specified governmental approvals — zoning changes, variances, subdivision plats, development agreements, or other permits necessary for the intended development program. Entitlement contingencies are critically important for projects that require discretionary governmental action, where approval is not guaranteed.

The scope of required entitlements must be precisely defined. A vague reference to "all necessary governmental approvals" creates ambiguity and potential disputes. Best practice is to attach as an exhibit a detailed development program (unit count, square footage, density, use mix) and list the specific approvals needed (e.g., "final subdivision plat approval from [County] for a residential development of not less than 150 single-family lots," or "approval of a conditional use permit for a hotel of not less than 200 keys"). If approvals are received for a materially lesser program, the buyer should have the right to terminate.

Entitlement periods are typically longer than general due diligence — often 12-36 months depending on the jurisdiction and complexity of the entitlement process. During this period, the contract remains in effect (with increasing hard money at milestones), the seller cannot convey the property to a third party, and the buyer actively pursues approvals. The buyer should have express rights to apply for and prosecute entitlements, with the seller obligated to execute any documents, applications, or appearances necessary to support the process.

The buyer's failure to diligently pursue entitlements is sometimes a grounds for seller termination, though defining "diligent pursuit" is difficult. Sellers prefer provisions requiring the buyer to make applications within a specified period, attend hearings, respond to agency comments within defined timelines, and continue appealing denials through specified appeal processes before having the right to terminate.

Importantly, governmental opposition to an entitlement is not the buyer's fault but can prevent closing. Both parties should agree upfront on the maximum time they are willing to spend pursuing entitlements, the minimum development program that would justify proceeding, and the buyout terms if entitlements are denied after good-faith pursuit.

## Seller Financing

Seller financing in land transactions allows the buyer to defer all or part of the purchase price, with the seller acting as lender secured by the land. This is particularly common where the land's value is contingent on successful entitlement or where conventional lenders will not finance raw land.

A typical seller-financed land deal involves: (1) a down payment at closing of 20-40% of the purchase price; (2) a promissory note from the buyer for the balance; (3) a deed of trust or mortgage securing the note; and (4) an interest rate, maturity, and amortization schedule. Seller financing rates are typically above conventional commercial rates, reflecting the risk that the seller remains economically exposed to the land's value.

Key seller financing terms include whether interest is current-pay or accrues (PIK), whether there are prepayment penalties or premiums, whether the buyer can further encumber the property with a construction loan (requiring the seller to subordinate or consent), and what recourse the seller has on default (deed-in-lieu, foreclosure, or personal recourse). Subordination of seller carryback to a construction loan is a significant concession by the seller; in exchange, sellers typically require a higher interest rate, personal guaranty from the buyer's principals, or a completion guaranty.

From a tax perspective, seller financing on an installment basis (payments spread over multiple tax years) may allow the seller to recognize gain on a pro-rata basis as principal payments are received, rather than recognizing all gain at closing. This installment sale tax treatment can be a significant motivation for sellers to offer seller financing, and buyers should understand this dynamic when negotiating.

## Option Agreements

An option gives the buyer the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to purchase land at a specified price (or formula) within a specified period, in exchange for an option fee paid upfront. Options are extensively used in land assembly, large development programs, and situations where the buyer needs time to secure entitlements or capital before being obligated to close.

Option fees are typically non-refundable and may or may not be credited toward the purchase price at exercise. In long-term options (1-5 years), the option fee may be paid in annual installments, with each year's payment keeping the option alive. The option price may be fixed at signing, subject to an escalation formula (e.g., 3% per year), or tied to a formula based on entitlement approvals.

An important drafting consideration is whether the option is "naked" (the buyer has no obligation to pursue entitlements or development) or whether it includes affirmative development obligations. Sellers prefer options with development obligations and milestone requirements to ensure the land is being actively worked toward productive use. Tax planning also affects option structure, as an option that is "too much like" a purchase can trigger transfer taxes or constructive ownership for the seller.

Rolling options — where the buyer has the right to purchase parcels of a larger assemblage in sequence, with each exercise triggering an option on the next parcel — are common in large residential land development programs. This allows the developer to phase capital deployment while locking in the entire future supply chain.

The recording of an option in the land records (memorialized in a memorandum of option) provides constructive notice to third parties and protects the option holder against intervening liens or sales. Option holders should record their interest promptly and should obtain ALTA title insurance on their option interest.

## Right of First Refusal

A right of first refusal (ROFR) gives the holder the right to match any bona fide third-party offer to purchase the property before the owner can accept it. ROFRs are commonly granted by sellers to their neighbors, adjacent landowners, or prior owners as part of a sale negotiation.

ROFRs impair the fee owner's ability to sell freely because any prospective buyer knows their offer can be matched, which reduces competitive bidding and can make the property harder to sell at full value. For this reason, sophisticated buyers resist granting ROFRs and sellers seek to have existing ROFRs subordinated or waived at closing.

The trigger for a ROFR is a "bona fide third-party offer" — meaning an arm's-length offer from a creditworthy buyer, typically evidenced by an executed LOI or PSA. The holder has a specified period (commonly 10-30 days) to exercise or waive the ROFR after receiving notice of the offer. If the holder exercises, they purchase on the same terms as the third-party offer. If they waive, the owner may sell to the third party only on terms at least as favorable as those disclosed. Any material modification to the terms requires re-offering to the ROFR holder.

Negotiation points include: the scope of the ROFR (does it apply to partial sales, foreclosure sales, involuntary transfers, or only voluntary arm's-length sales?); the exercise period; the information that must be disclosed when a third-party offer is received; and whether the ROFR survives in the chain of title or terminates on first conveyance.

## Ground Lease Structures

A ground lease is a long-term lease of land (typically 50-99 years) on which the lessee (ground tenant) constructs and owns improvements. Ground leases allow landowners to monetize land value without selling, and allow developers to acquire the use of land without the capital required for outright purchase.

The core economic terms of a ground lease include: the initial rent (typically calculated as a percentage of land value — commonly 5-8% of appraised land value per annum in institutional transactions); rent reset provisions (commonly every 10-25 years to reset rent to a percentage of then-current market land value); rent escalation between resets (CPI or fixed percentage); and the disposition of improvements at lease expiration (improvements typically revert to the landowner).

A leasehold mortgage (financing secured by the ground tenant's leasehold interest, not the land) requires that the ground lease include specific protections for lenders: the right to receive notice of any default, a cure period in addition to the tenant's cure period, the right to obtain a "new lease" if the ground lease is terminated due to tenant default, and a non-disturbance agreement preventing the landowner from interfering with the leasehold mortgage.

Subordinated ground leases — where the landowner subordinates their fee interest to the ground tenant's construction or permanent financing — dramatically increase the landowner's risk (they could lose the land in a foreclosure) but improve the lessee's financing terms. Unsubordinated ground leases are more protective to landowners but create financing challenges. The trend in institutional transactions is toward unsubordinated leases with robust lender protections in the lease itself, as lenders have become more experienced with leasehold financing and more comfortable with the new-lease remedy as adequate protection.

The tax treatment of ground leases is complex. Rent received by the landowner is ordinary income. The reversionary interest (the right to receive improvements at lease expiration) is a property right that is not taxed until realized. From a lessee perspective, ground rent is an operating expense, reducing taxable income — which is a meaningful benefit for a highly leveraged development. Ground leases in charitable or institutional ownership (universities, municipalities, religious organizations) can provide particularly favorable economics if the landowner's tax-exempt status eliminates property tax on the land portion.
