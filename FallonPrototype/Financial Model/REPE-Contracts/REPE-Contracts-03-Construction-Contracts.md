# Reference Document 03: Construction Contracts (GMP and Lump Sum)
## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Construction contracts are among the most operationally consequential documents in a real estate development deal. Budget overruns, schedule delays, and contractor disputes can destroy returns that look excellent on paper. The primary contract forms used in institutional development are the AIA (American Institute of Architects) standard forms, particularly the A101 (Owner/Contractor Stipulated Sum), A102 (Owner/Contractor GMP), and A133 (Owner/CM GMP). In practice, institutional owners heavily modify these standard forms through owner-prepared supplementary conditions that shift risk, increase contractor accountability, and expand owner remedies. Understanding the standard provisions and the modifications that sophisticated owners push for is essential.

## Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Provisions

A GMP contract commits the general contractor (GC) to deliver the project for no more than a stated maximum price. Any cost savings below the GMP may be shared between owner and contractor (a savings split, typically 50/50 or 75/25 in the owner's favor), while any costs above the GMP are borne entirely by the contractor. The GMP thus converts cost risk from the owner to the contractor, in exchange for which the contractor receives a higher fee than they would on a cost-plus arrangement.

The GMP is typically established in one of two ways. In "open book" GMP arrangements, the owner reviews the contractor's subcontractor bids and cost buildup before the GMP is set, with full transparency into the underlying costs. In "closed book" GMPs, the contractor presents a final price and the owner accepts or rejects it without access to subcontractor pricing. Institutional owners almost universally prefer open book GMP contracting because it reveals the contractor's actual cost basis and makes savings splits meaningful.

The GMP document typically consists of: (1) the contract sum (the GMP amount); (2) the GMP basis documents (drawings, specifications, and any clarifications on which the GMP is based); (3) allowances included in the GMP for scope items not yet fully defined; (4) the contractor's contingency included in the GMP for foreseeable risks (typically 3-7% of estimated construction cost); (5) owner's contingency held outside the GMP (typically 3-10% depending on project complexity and design completion at GMP setting); and (6) the contractor's fee, expressed as a percentage of actual cost (typically 3-5% for large commercial projects).

The GMP basis documents — the drawings and specifications on which the GMP was priced — are critically important. If subsequent design development reveals scope not shown in the basis documents, the contractor has a legitimate change order claim. Setting the GMP too early in the design process (with incomplete documents) shifts risk to the contractor and often results in scope disputes, excessive change orders, or an artificially high GMP that incorporates risk premiums for unknown conditions. Industry best practice is to set the GMP with at least 85-90% complete construction documents.

## Lump Sum Contract Provisions

In a lump sum (stipulated sum) contract, the contractor agrees to deliver the project for a fixed price, bearing all cost risk above that amount regardless of cause (subject to change order rights). Lump sum contracts require substantially complete design documents (typically 90-100% construction documents) at the time of bidding, because the contractor cannot accurately price what is not fully defined.

The advantage of lump sum contracting is price certainty for the owner. The disadvantage is that lump sum bids tend to be higher than GMP contracts because the contractor prices in risk premiums for unknown conditions. Additionally, contractors on lump sum contracts have an incentive to interpret contract documents narrowly, asserting change orders for any scope that was arguably not in the original documents, because change orders are their only mechanism to recover margin on a fixed-price deal.

Owner-friendly lump sum contracts include provisions that require the contractor to have independently verified site conditions before bidding, limit the contractor's right to claim for differing site conditions, require the contractor to notify the owner of design conflicts or ambiguities before bidding (preventing claims for conflicts discovered post-bid), and impose strict timelines for change order requests with a waiver of claims not raised within specified periods.

Lump sum contracts are also typically used for smaller, well-defined scopes of work (tenant improvements, amenity renovations) where the design is fully complete and competitive bidding produces a true market price. For new ground-up construction on complex programs, GMP with an open book is generally preferred by sophisticated institutional owners who have the resources to manage the process.

## Change Order Procedures

A change order is a modification to the contract scope, price, or schedule signed by both owner and contractor. Change orders are the primary vehicle through which contractors attempt to increase the contract sum, and controlling the change order process is one of the owner's most important rights.

Standard AIA change order provisions allow the contractor to request a change order for: (1) owner-directed changes to scope; (2) unforeseen conditions not shown on the contract documents; (3) design errors or omissions requiring corrective work; and (4) owner-caused delays. Institutional owners typically narrow these rights significantly through supplementary conditions.

The change order process in a well-drafted contract requires: (1) written notice from the contractor within a specified period after the event giving rise to the change (typically 7-21 days, with strict enforcement — any claim not noticed within this window is waived); (2) the contractor's detailed cost breakdown for the proposed change, with supporting documentation (subcontractor quotes, material takeoffs); (3) the owner's written approval before any work is performed; and (4) execution of a formal change order document before payment for the change. Change orders executed only by the contractor's project manager (without owner signature) are not binding on the owner.

A key risk is constructive change orders — situations where the owner directs work that the contractor treats as a change but for which no formal change order is executed. Courts generally require owners to pay for owner-directed work even without a signed change order, which is why owner representative oversight is critical in preventing unauthorized directions to contractors. Owner's project managers and architects must be trained to direct all scope changes through the formal change order process.

The contractor's overhead and profit markup on change orders is a negotiation point. Industry standard (and AIA default) is 15-20% OH&P on change orders, though institutional owners often negotiate this down to 10-15%, particularly where the contractor's fee on the base contract is adequate. The agreed markup percentage should be locked into the contract to prevent disputes on each individual change order.

## Retainage

Retainage is a percentage of each progress payment that is withheld by the owner as security for the contractor's performance and correction of defective work. Standard retainage is 10% of the contract sum, though many states have statutes specifying maximum retainage rates and requiring its release after substantial completion.

In practice, sophisticated owners often structure retainage as follows: 10% through 50% project completion; reducing to 5% from 50% through substantial completion; 0% retainage on stored materials (to avoid penalizing contractors who pre-purchase materials); and full retainage release within 30 days of final completion (or final payment, whichever is later). Reducing retainage after 50% completion is a significant concession to the contractor, and in exchange the owner should require the contractor to provide sufficient lien waivers and ensure no subcontractor disputes remain open.

Some states (including California, Florida, and Texas) have specific retainage statutes that may override contract provisions. Owners operating in multiple states must comply with applicable state law on retainage withholding and release timing, as violations can expose owners to interest, penalties, and loss of lien rights.

The purpose of retainage is twofold: it provides a fund to correct defective work if the contractor defaults before completion, and it incentivizes the contractor to complete punch list items and final documentation. However, retainage creates a cash flow burden on subcontractors and has been criticized as an industry practice that disadvantages smaller subcontractors. Some sophisticated owners adopt a "Retainage Reform" model where retainage is reduced or eliminated once the contractor has demonstrated sufficient performance, with alternative security (a performance bond or letter of credit) substituted.

Retainage flow-down to subcontractors is a related issue. GC contracts with subcontractors typically mirror the retainage terms of the prime contract, but GCs sometimes hold subcontractor retainage above the rate held by the owner — a practice sometimes called "retainage skimming." Owner-friendly GMP contracts require the GC to hold subcontractor retainage at the same rate as owner-held GC retainage.

## Liquidated Damages

Liquidated damages (LDs) are predetermined daily amounts that the contractor owes the owner for each day of delay beyond the specified substantial completion date. LDs serve two purposes: they compensate the owner for actual delay damages (which may be difficult to prove in litigation) and they incentivize the contractor to complete on schedule.

To be enforceable, LDs must be a reasonable estimate of actual damages anticipated at the time of contracting, not a penalty. Courts scrutinize LD provisions and will void those that are disproportionate to actual harm. For this reason, owners should document their LD calculation in project records, typically by estimating: (1) carrying costs on the construction loan (interest and fees) for each day of delay; (2) lost revenue from delayed project opening or lease commencement; (3) owner overhead attributable to the delay (project management costs, legal costs); and (4) consequential damages from tenant lease obligations (TI completion deadlines, rent commencement triggers).

Typical LD amounts in commercial construction range from $2,000 to $10,000 per day on small-to-medium projects, up to $25,000-$75,000 per day on large mixed-use or hotel projects. For projects with anchor tenant opening obligations or brand-critical opening dates (e.g., a flag hotel with a soft opening event), LDs can be substantially higher.

Contractors resist LDs and seek to either eliminate them or cap total LD exposure at a percentage of the contract sum (commonly 5-10%). Owners resist caps because a sophisticated contractor may calculate that completing late is economically rational if LDs are capped below actual delay damages. The compromise is often a higher-than-requested LD daily rate with a cap, combined with owner rights to complete the work at the contractor's expense if delays exceed specified thresholds.

The owner's right to collect LDs is typically conditioned on the owner not having caused any delay. Where delays are concurrent (both owner and contractor have contributed to the same period of delay), the majority rule in U.S. courts is that no LDs are owed for concurrent delay periods, though some agreements and some states allow apportionment of concurrent delays. Keeping detailed contemporaneous records of delay events — and their causes — is essential for both parties.

## Substantial Completion

Substantial completion is the contractual milestone at which the project is sufficiently complete for its intended use, even if minor items remain on the punch list. Substantial completion is significant because it typically triggers: (1) commencement of the warranty period; (2) transfer of risk of loss from the contractor to the owner; (3) the owner's obligation to pay retainage (minus punch list holdback); (4) cessation of LD accrual; and (5) the contractor's right to payment of the contract sum minus retainage and punch list holdback.

AIA A101 defines substantial completion as the stage "when the Work or designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its intended use." This definition is deliberately imprecise, and disputes over whether substantial completion has occurred are common.

Owner-protective substantial completion provisions include: (1) requiring a certificate of occupancy (CO) from the applicable authority having jurisdiction as a condition of substantial completion; (2) requiring all life-safety systems to be operational and inspected; (3) requiring completion of all work required for the owner's first tenant to take occupancy; (4) requiring all specified equipment to be commissioned and tested; and (5) requiring delivery of all operations and maintenance manuals, warranties, and as-built drawings before the substantial completion date is recognized.

Contractors resist CO-based substantial completion because CO issuance is often within governmental control and may be delayed by agency backlog unrelated to the contractor's performance. A compromise is to require that the project is ready for CO inspection and that the contractor has made all submissions to the building department, while allowing substantial completion to be achieved even if CO is pending due to agency processing delays, so long as the contractor has cured all building department comments and there is no remaining contractor-caused impediment to CO issuance.

## Punch List Procedures

The punch list (also called the deficiency list or punchout list) is a record of items identified at substantial completion that remain incomplete or require correction. Punch list procedures govern how these items are identified, documented, and resolved.

Best practice punch list procedures include: (1) a joint walk of the project by owner's representative, architect, and contractor at substantial completion; (2) a written punch list issued within a specified period (commonly 7-10 days after the walk); (3) contractor obligation to complete all punch list items within a specified period (commonly 30-60 days); (4) owner right to engage third parties to complete uncompleted punch list items at the contractor's expense if the contractor fails to complete within the specified period; and (5) withholding of a punch list holdback from the final payment (typically 150-200% of the estimated cost to complete punch list items), released upon final completion.

Contractors should not be allowed to dispute punch list items as a condition of beginning work on them — the dispute resolution process is separate from the obligation to perform. Allowing contractors to refuse punch list items pending dispute resolution effectively holds the building hostage to negotiation. However, contractors may have legitimate objections (e.g., an item is owner-caused, not contractor-caused), and those disputes should be processed through the contract's dispute resolution mechanism while work continues.

The distinction between punch list items and warranty claims is important. A punch list item is unfinished construction — work that was not completed at substantial completion. A warranty claim arises after substantial completion when work that was complete fails due to defective materials or workmanship. Punch list holdback is the security for the former; the warranty bond or contractor's general obligation is the security for the latter. Owners should clearly document when an item first manifested (before or after substantial completion) to correctly categorize it.

## Contractor Default and Termination for Cause

A contractor default occurs when the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the contract — whether by abandoning the project, failing to pay subcontractors (causing lien exposure), performing defective work, or falling materially behind schedule. Termination for cause is the owner's remedy, but it must be exercised carefully to avoid claims that the owner wrongfully terminated and thereby owes the contractor lost profits.

The AIA contract requires the owner to give the contractor 7 days' written notice before terminating for cause. The contractor has that period to cure the default or begin a cure plan. If the contractor fails to cure, the owner may terminate and take possession of the site. Upon termination for cause, the owner may complete the work by whatever method it deems appropriate, and the contractor is liable for all costs to complete in excess of the original contract price, plus all other damages resulting from the default.

Before terminating for cause, owners should: (1) document all defaults contemporaneously; (2) send required notices through the contractual notice mechanism (typically certified mail or overnight courier to a specific address); (3) consult with the surety on the contractor's performance bond before terminating, as the surety's cooperation is essential to completing the project at the contractor's expense; and (4) engage legal counsel to review the termination decision, as a wrongful termination claim by the contractor can result in damages equal to the contractor's expected profit on the remaining work.

## Performance Bonds and Payment Bonds

A performance bond is issued by a surety company and guarantees that if the contractor defaults, the surety will either complete the project, engage a replacement contractor, or pay the owner's damages up to the bond amount (equal to the contract sum). A payment bond guarantees that the contractor will pay all subcontractors, suppliers, and laborers, protecting the owner against mechanic's lien claims.

Requiring performance and payment bonds from the GC is standard on institutional public projects and increasingly common on private commercial development. Bond premiums are typically 0.5-1.5% of the contract sum, paid by the contractor (and typically included in the contract price). The threshold for requiring bonds in private development is commonly projects above $5-10 million, though some sophisticated institutional owners require bonds on all projects regardless of size.

The surety's obligations under a performance bond arise only upon a valid contractor default declared by the owner, following proper notice and a cure period. The surety has the right to investigate the default, and if it disputes the owner's default declaration, litigation may be necessary to compel surety performance. Owners should therefore follow all contractual notice and cure procedures precisely before declaring default, and should document contractor performance failures contemporaneously. Premature declaration of default — before the required cure period has expired — can void the surety's bond obligations.

A payment bond claim requires a claimant (subcontractor or supplier) to give notice within a specified period after completing work and receiving no payment, typically 90-120 days under the Miller Act (federal projects) or applicable state little-Miller Act statutes. On private projects, payment bonds function as an alternative to mechanic's liens, but the claimant must follow the bond's notice and claim procedures precisely or forfeit their rights.
