# Reference Document 04: Commercial Tenant Leases
## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Commercial leases are the primary revenue instrument of income-producing real estate. For real estate private equity, the lease is not merely a tenancy agreement — it is a cash-flow contract that determines asset value as surely as any underwriting assumption. Every material lease term either supports or undermines the income, credit quality, and exit value of the asset. A thorough understanding of NNN structures, expense reconciliation, tenant protections, and landlord remedies is essential to both asset management and investment underwriting.

## NNN (Triple Net) Lease Structures

A triple net (NNN) lease requires the tenant to pay, in addition to base rent, three categories of operating costs: property taxes, building insurance premiums, and operating/maintenance expenses (including CAM — common area maintenance). In a "pure" NNN lease, the landlord receives base rent with virtually no deductions, and the tenant absorbs all ownership costs other than debt service and capital improvements.

In practice, the definition of "net" varies dramatically. A gross lease covers all expenses. A single-net lease requires the tenant to pay property taxes only. A double-net (NN) lease covers taxes and insurance. A triple-net (NNN) lease covers taxes, insurance, and operating expenses. A "bondable" or "absolute NNN" lease goes further, requiring the tenant to maintain the building structure and roof, make all capital repairs, and even continue paying rent if the building is destroyed — creating a lease structure that functions economically like a bond. Bondable NNN leases are most common with credit-tenant retailers (national pharmacy chains, fast food operators with 20+ year leases) and are the basis for net lease REIT valuations.

Landlords underwriting NNN investments must scrutinize what expenses are excluded from CAM charges to the tenant. Standard landlord-favorable exclusions from CAM pass-through include management fees, capital expenditures (roof replacement, HVAC replacement), and costs attributable to landlord's negligence. Tenants push for additional exclusions: marketing and advertising costs, leasing commissions, depreciation, debt service, reserves for replacements, and costs to attract or retain other tenants.

The NNN structure creates significant due diligence obligations for investors. A building with seemingly strong NNN rent may have substantial capital expenditure requirements that the landlord bears, consuming cash flow. Estimating realistic CapEx reserves — which are landlord obligations not recoverable from tenants in most NNN structures — is a critical underwriting step.

## CAM Reconciliation

CAM (common area maintenance) charges are the tenant's pro-rata share of costs incurred to maintain common areas of a building or shopping center. For multi-tenant properties, CAM is estimated at the beginning of each calendar year, collected monthly from tenants as part of rent, and reconciled against actual costs at year-end.

The CAM reconciliation process works as follows. At the beginning of each year, the landlord prepares an operating expense budget and calculates each tenant's estimated monthly CAM contribution based on their pro-rata share (typically calculated as the tenant's leased square footage divided by total rentable building square footage, though many leases define a custom "denominator"). Throughout the year, tenants pay their monthly CAM estimate. At year-end, the landlord reconciles actual expenses against estimated collections. Tenants who underpaid receive a reconciliation bill (a "true-up"); tenants who overpaid receive a credit.

Critical CAM reconciliation provisions include: the timeline for delivering the annual CAM reconciliation statement (commonly 90-180 days after year-end); the tenant's right to audit landlord's books and records to verify CAM calculations (typically within 1-2 years of receiving the reconciliation statement, with results binding if not challenged); and what happens if the landlord fails to deliver the reconciliation statement on time (some leases deem the estimated amount correct if no statement is delivered timely).

CAM caps are a major tenant negotiation point. A "controllable CAM cap" limits annual increases in the tenant's controllable CAM obligations (those under the landlord's management discretion, typically excluding property taxes, insurance premiums, and utilities) to a specified percentage — commonly 3-5% per year on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis. Uncapped CAM leaves tenants exposed to cost-shifting by landlords who have little incentive to control operating costs if all increases pass through. Landlords resist hard caps because their actual costs may exceed the cap, creating negative operating leverage.

"Gross-up" provisions require the landlord to calculate variable operating expenses (those that increase with occupancy, such as cleaning and utilities) as if the building were 90-100% occupied, even if actual occupancy is lower. Gross-up protects anchor tenants from subsidizing a landlord's vacancy — without it, a 50%-occupied building would charge remaining tenants 2x their fair share of variable costs. Gross-up is standard in institutional leases for office and retail properties.

## Co-Tenancy Clauses

A co-tenancy clause gives a tenant the right to pay reduced rent (a "co-tenancy rent") or terminate the lease if specified "co-tenants" — typically anchor tenants or a minimum occupancy percentage — fail to open, close, or cease operations at the property. Co-tenancy provisions are most common in retail leases where a tenant's sales performance depends heavily on the presence of traffic-generating anchors.

Opening co-tenancy provisions condition the tenant's obligation to open and pay full rent on the occurrence of specified conditions at delivery — typically the opening of named anchor tenants and/or a minimum percentage of the project's tenant spaces. If those conditions are not met at delivery, the tenant may delay opening, pay reduced rent during the cure period, or ultimately terminate if the co-tenancy condition is not cured within a specified period (commonly 12-24 months).

Ongoing co-tenancy provisions address what happens after opening if a co-tenant closes. Typically, the tenant is entitled to a reduced "co-tenancy rent" (commonly a percentage of gross sales rather than fixed base rent) during the period the co-tenancy failure persists. If the landlord fails to replace the required co-tenant within a cure period (commonly 6-18 months), the tenant has the right to terminate the lease.

Landlords heavily resist co-tenancy provisions because they can cascade — if one anchor closes, triggering co-tenancy elections by in-line tenants, those elections can further damage the property's revenue, making it harder to attract a replacement anchor. Landlords negotiate for: narrow co-tenancy definitions (specific named tenants only, not minimum occupancy thresholds); long cure periods; caps on the number of co-tenancy elections the tenant can exercise; and replacement of named anchors with comparable tenants satisfying objective criteria (minimum square footage, national credit rating).

## Exclusivity Provisions

An exclusivity clause prohibits the landlord from leasing other space in the project (and sometimes in competing properties within a radius) to a business that competes with the tenant. Exclusivity is critically important to certain tenants — a coffee shop does not want a second coffee shop in the same center; a specialty retailer does not want a directly competing retailer 100 feet away.

The scope of exclusivity must be precisely defined. A broad exclusivity clause that prohibits "any business that competes with tenant" is difficult to administer and may prevent the landlord from leasing to businesses that only tangentially overlap with the tenant's offering. Well-drafted exclusivity provisions define: (1) the specific products or services that are exclusive (e.g., "the sale of handcrafted artisanal coffee beverages"); (2) the geographic scope (the center, the project, a radius around the center); (3) carve-outs for existing tenants who are already in the center and whose leases predate the exclusivity grant; and (4) remedies for violation (reduction in rent, termination, or injunctive relief and damages).

Landlords push back on broad exclusivity because it limits their leasing flexibility and can make the center less attractive to complementary tenants. The landlord's goal is to narrowly define the exclusive use and carve out as many existing and future uses as possible. Tenants' goal is broad exclusivity that captures all competitors.

## Continuous Operation Clauses and Go-Dark Provisions

A continuous operation clause requires the tenant to remain open and operating throughout the lease term, preventing the tenant from "going dark" (ceasing operations while continuing to pay rent). Continuous operation is important for landlords of retail centers because a dark store damages the center's traffic, affects other tenants' sales, and undermines the landlord's ability to attract new tenants.

Requiring continuous operation is increasingly difficult to negotiate from a strong tenant. National credit tenants have significant leverage to resist continuous operation requirements and often insist on the right to go dark at their discretion. Landlords counter with: (1) a termination right allowing the landlord to recapture the space if the tenant goes dark for more than a specified period (commonly 90-180 days); (2) a right to convert the tenant's rent from fixed to percentage rent if the tenant is dark; and (3) required minimum hours of operation during peak periods.

A "go-dark" provision is the tenant-favorable counterpart: it expressly gives the tenant the right to cease operations while continuing to pay rent. Landlords resist go-dark provisions except when dealing with credit tenants of sufficient quality that empty rent is preferable to the expense and disruption of re-leasing. When go-dark provisions are accepted, landlords typically negotiate a landlord recapture right triggered after an extended dark period.

## Percentage Rent

Percentage rent is additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenant's gross sales above a specified "breakpoint." It is most common in retail leases and allows the landlord to participate in the tenant's upside performance above a baseline.

The breakpoint is the gross sales level above which percentage rent applies. A "natural breakpoint" is calculated by dividing the base rent by the percentage rate (e.g., if base rent is $100,000/year and the percentage rate is 5%, the natural breakpoint is $2,000,000 — meaning percentage rent applies when sales exceed $2,000,000). An "artificial breakpoint" is negotiated at a level above the natural breakpoint, reducing the instances where percentage rent is payable.

Gross sales definitions are heavily negotiated. Tenants seek to exclude from gross sales: internet sales, sales not consummated on the premises, returns and refunds, sales taxes, employee sales at discount, and sales from other locations. Landlords seek to include as much revenue as possible. The rise of omnichannel retail has made gross sales definitions particularly contested, as a significant percentage of a retailer's revenue may now be attributable to online orders fulfilled from store inventory or store-facilitated sales.

## SNDA Agreements

A Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment (SNDA) agreement governs the relationship between the tenant, landlord, and landlord's lender. It is a three-party agreement with critical importance in a foreclosure scenario.

Subordination means the tenant agrees that its lease is subordinate to the landlord's mortgage — in a foreclosure, the lender's lien takes priority over the tenant's possessory rights. Without subordination, a tenant who entered the lease before the mortgage was recorded might have superior rights in a foreclosure, which creates significant complications for lenders.

Non-disturbance means the lender agrees that if foreclosure occurs and the lender (or a foreclosure purchaser) takes title, the lender will not disturb the tenant's occupancy as long as the tenant is not in default under its lease. Non-disturbance is essential for tenants: without it, a tenant is exposed to eviction by a new owner despite having a valid, long-term lease. Credit tenants universally require non-disturbance as a condition of entering a lease.

Attornment means the tenant agrees to recognize the new owner (whether the lender or a foreclosure purchaser) as its new landlord and continue paying rent to them. Attornment is necessary for continuity of the tenancy after ownership transfer.

The interplay of these three provisions creates the SNDA: the tenant subordinates and agrees to attorn, but only because it received non-disturbance protection. Lenders routinely require SNDAs from all tenants as a condition of originating a mortgage. Tenants require SNDAs before entering long-term leases. The SNDA should be recorded in the land records to provide notice to future parties.

## Estoppel Certificates

An estoppel certificate is a written statement by the tenant, delivered to the landlord or a third party (such as a prospective buyer or lender), confirming the status of the lease and the existence or absence of any landlord defaults. Estoppel certificates are critical in real estate transactions because they provide the buyer or lender with tenant-confirmed facts that cannot later be contradicted by the tenant.

Standard estoppel certificates confirm: the lease commencement and expiration dates; the current base rent; the tenant's security deposit; whether the landlord has performed all obligations (including TI delivery and free rent periods); whether the tenant has any claims, defenses, or rights of offset against the landlord; whether any options (renewal, expansion, purchase) have been exercised; and whether the tenant is in default.

Most leases require tenants to execute and deliver estoppel certificates within 10-20 business days of landlord's request, with failure to deliver deemed an affirmation that the statements in the landlord's form are accurate. This "deemed estoppel" provision is a powerful landlord protection. Tenants who are habitually slow to deliver estoppels can delay closings and financing, which is why lease forms should include tight timelines with specific default consequences.

## Tenant Improvement (TI) Allowance and Delivery Conditions

A TI allowance is a landlord contribution toward the cost of tenant improvements — the buildout of the tenant's leased space. TI allowances are expressed as a dollar amount per rentable square foot and are either fixed or dependent on lease term (longer leases command higher TI allowances).

TI delivery conditions specify how and when the TI allowance is disbursed. Common disbursement structures include: (1) reimbursement of tenant's actual construction costs upon delivery of invoices, lien waivers, and certificate of substantial completion; (2) staged disbursements at defined project milestones; (3) landlord direct payment to general contractor; and (4) lump sum payment at lease commencement, regardless of construction cost (rare, and only for credit tenants).

Critical TI drafting points include: whether the TI allowance may be applied to soft costs (design, permitting) in addition to hard construction costs; the deadline by which the tenant must complete improvements and draw down the TI (commonly 12-24 months, with forfeiture if unused); whether unused TI may be applied to rent abatement; and the tenant's obligation to deliver lien waivers from all subcontractors and suppliers before each TI disbursement.

Landlords who deliver TI late — or who fail to deliver the shell space in required condition — expose themselves to tenant claims for delay damages, lease termination rights (if delivery conditions include a "drop dead date"), and rent abatement. Lease provisions should clearly define the condition in which the landlord must deliver the premises (cold shell, warm shell, or vanilla shell), the required delivery date, and the consequence of delay.

## Renewal Options, Expansion Options, and Rights of First Offer

Renewal options give the tenant the right to extend the lease term for a specified period at specified economic terms (fixed rent, fair market rent, or a formula). Renewal options protect tenants who have invested in buildout from forced relocation and give the tenant's business planning certainty.

Fair market value renewals require the parties to agree on market rent at the time of exercise, with a dispute resolution mechanism (appraisal or arbitration) if they cannot agree. These are landlord-favorable because they allow rent to reset to market. Fixed-rent renewals give tenants certainty but may lock in below-market rent for landlords if the market improves. Most institutional leases use a hybrid: fair market value renewal with a floor (rent cannot decrease below in-place rent) and sometimes a ceiling.

Expansion options give the tenant the right to lease additional space in the building on specified terms. These may be triggered at a specified time (e.g., at year 3 of the initial term), when certain space becomes available, or at the tenant's election at any time. Landlords resist expansion options on unspecified space because they interfere with leasing other space in the building and may commit the landlord to terms established years earlier that no longer reflect market conditions.

A right of first offer (ROFO) gives the tenant the right to receive the landlord's offer on adjacent or available space before the landlord markets it to third parties. A right of first refusal (ROFR) gives the tenant the right to match a third-party offer on such space. ROFOs are generally preferred by landlords because they preserve some ability to set market price; ROFRs are preferred by tenants because they guarantee the ability to match any price. Both provisions must carefully define the applicable space, the tenant's exercise period, and what happens if the tenant does not exercise (the landlord must complete the deal on terms no more favorable than disclosed to the tenant).

## Assignment and Subletting

Assignment and subletting restrictions limit the tenant's ability to transfer the lease to a third party without landlord consent. Standard commercial leases prohibit assignment and subletting without the landlord's prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed (the "reasonable consent" standard).

What constitutes reasonable grounds for refusal is often litigated. Generally accepted reasonable grounds include: the proposed assignee's creditworthiness is materially inferior to the original tenant; the proposed use is incompatible with the building's image or other tenants; the proposed use violates exclusivity provisions granted to other tenants; or the proposed assignee plans to significantly alter the space. Landlords may not unreasonably refuse to protect their position or to force the tenant to pay more rent.

Many leases give the landlord a "recapture" right — if the tenant requests an assignment or subletting, the landlord may terminate the lease (or the relevant portion) and deal directly with the proposed assignee/sublessee. This prevents tenants from profiting from subleasing at above-market rates without sharing with the landlord. Recapture rights also give landlords flexibility to re-lease to the third party at current market terms.

Change-of-control provisions extend assignment restrictions to indirect transfers: if a change in control of the tenant entity (typically defined as a transfer of more than 50% of voting control) occurs, it is deemed an assignment requiring landlord consent. This prevents tenants from circumventing assignment restrictions through ownership-level transfers.
