# Reference Document 01: Joint Venture / LP-GP Agreements
## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Joint venture and limited partnership agreements form the legal and economic backbone of real estate private equity transactions. These documents govern the relationship between the general partner (GP), who manages the investment, and the limited partners (LPs), who provide the bulk of the equity capital. The central tension in any JV or LP-GP agreement is the alignment of interests: LPs want the GP to act prudently with their capital, while GPs want to preserve discretion and participate meaningfully in upside. Every major provision in these agreements reflects that tension.

## Waterfall Structures

The distribution waterfall determines how cash flows from a real estate investment are divided between the GP and LPs. Waterfalls are structured as a sequential series of tiers: each tier must be fully satisfied before distributions cascade to the next.

A standard four-tier waterfall operates as follows. First, all capital contributed by both LP and GP is returned in full. Second, LPs receive their preferred return on contributed capital, typically expressed as a cumulative annual percentage (commonly 8% per annum, compounded annually or quarterly). Third, there is often a GP catch-up tier, discussed separately below. Fourth, remaining distributions are split between the GP and LP in agreed proportions, with the GP's share constituting the promote.

The critical negotiation point is whether the waterfall runs on a deal-by-deal basis or on an aggregate fund basis (European vs. American structure, addressed in depth in Document 05). Within a single JV, the waterfall typically applies to the combined investment, but some JV structures apply separate waterfalls to distinct phases or tranches of equity.

Market standard for open-market institutional JVs typically runs 80/20 LP/GP splits at the first tier of promote, stepping up to 70/30 or 65/35 at higher MOIC or IRR thresholds. Value-add deals commonly start promote at 20% above an 8% preferred return. Opportunistic deals may offer higher promote (25-35%) but at steeper hurdles.

## Preferred Return Mechanics

The preferred return (also called "pref") is the minimum annualized return LPs must receive before the GP participates in profits. It is not a guaranteed return — it is a priority in the distribution waterfall. If the deal does not generate sufficient returns, LPs may not receive their full preferred return, and the GP receives no promote.

Preferred returns are typically calculated as a simple or compound annual percentage of invested capital. Compound preferred returns are more LP-favorable because accrued unpaid pref compounds on itself, creating a larger hurdle for the GP to clear. The compounding period matters: quarterly compounding results in a higher effective annual rate than annual compounding on the same nominal rate.

A key negotiation point is whether the preferred return is calculated on committed capital or drawn capital. Calculating pref on committed capital (even when not yet deployed) is LP-favorable and common in blind-pool fund structures. In project-level JVs, pref is almost always calculated only on invested (drawn) capital.

Some structures include a "hard" preferred return, which must be paid before any distribution whatsoever. Others use a "soft" preferred return, where the GP may receive distributions pari passu with LPs up to a threshold, with true-up at exit. Hard preferred returns dominate institutional transactions.

The compounding period also affects how the pref interacts with the catch-up. If the preferred return compounds quarterly, the GP's catch-up obligation at the end of the preferred return tier is larger than if the pref compounds annually on the same nominal rate. Sponsors modeling fund economics must correctly reflect the compounding convention in their waterfall model, as errors here can produce materially incorrect carry projections.

## Promote Calculations and MOIC/IRR Hurdles

The promote (also called carried interest) is the GP's share of profits above the preferred return. Promotes are triggered by one of two hurdle types: an IRR hurdle, a MOIC hurdle, or both.

An IRR hurdle measures the time-value-adjusted return on invested capital. Because IRR is sensitive to the timing of cash flows, it rewards GPs who return capital quickly and penalizes slow distributions. An 8% IRR hurdle is common for core-plus deals; 12-15% hurdles are more common in value-add; 15-20% in opportunistic.

A MOIC (multiple on invested capital) hurdle is a simpler measure: total distributions divided by total invested capital. A 1.5x MOIC hurdle means LPs must receive $1.50 for every $1.00 contributed before the promote kicks in. MOIC hurdles are sometimes stacked alongside IRR hurdles, requiring both to be satisfied before promote is earned. Where both are required, the GP faces a blended test that limits promote on deals that return capital quickly at low total profit, or deals that earn high multiples over long hold periods with modest IRR.

Multi-tier promote structures step up the GP's percentage at higher performance thresholds. A common structure: 20% promote above an 8% pref; 25% above a 12% IRR or 1.8x MOIC; 30% above a 15% IRR or 2.0x MOIC. These step-ups incentivize outperformance and are considered best practice in institutional joint ventures.

## Catch-Up Provisions

A catch-up provision allows the GP to "catch up" to its promote percentage after the preferred return hurdle is cleared, before returning to the agreed LP/GP split. Once LPs have received their invested capital plus preferred return, 100% (or some percentage) of additional distributions flow to the GP until the GP has received an amount equal to its promote percentage applied to total profits.

A full catch-up works as follows: if the promote is 20% and the preferred return has been met, all distributions temporarily flow 100% to the GP until the GP has received 20% of all profits distributed to that point. Only then do distributions return to the 80/20 LP/GP split. A partial catch-up directs, say, 50% to the GP during this phase, which slows the catch-up but is LP-favorable.

Some agreements omit catch-up entirely. In that case, the promote only applies to dollars above the hurdle, resulting in a lower effective carry for the GP on the same total return. The presence and percentage of the catch-up is one of the most significant economic negotiation points in any waterfall.

The mechanics of a catch-up calculation must be precise. The GP is entitled to catch up to an amount such that, when all profits are considered together, the GP has received exactly its promote percentage of total profits (not just the profits above the hurdle). Imprecise drafting that simply gives the GP 100% of distributions "until caught up" without specifying the target amount can result in over- or under-payment to the GP.

## Clawback Provisions

A clawback requires the GP to return promote previously distributed if, on a final accounting at the end of the investment period, the GP has received more carry than it was entitled to earn based on aggregate performance. Clawbacks are essential LP protections in deal-by-deal waterfall structures (American waterfalls), where the GP may collect promote on early-exiting profitable deals while later deals in the same fund underperform.

A standard clawback provision requires the GP (and often its principals personally) to return excess carry at the end of the fund's life. The clawback obligation is typically net of taxes paid on the distributed carry, meaning the GP returns the after-tax amount. This tax haircut is a critical negotiation point: LPs may push for a gross (pre-tax) clawback or a "tax gross-up" that assumes the GP can fully recover taxes paid. GPs resist gross clawbacks because they may have to fund the return from personal assets if taxes are not recoverable.

Practical enforceability is a concern. By the time the fund winds down, carry may have been distributed years earlier and spent. Best practice is to require GPs and key principals to maintain an escrow account equal to a percentage of carry received (typically 20-30%) to fund potential clawback obligations. Some LP-friendly agreements require a letter of credit or personal guarantee from key principals.

An "interim clawback" provision allows LPs to trigger a clawback calculation at specified intervals during the fund's life — for example, at the midpoint of the fund term or upon the occurrence of a defined trigger event. Interim clawbacks are rare but increasingly discussed in LP communities as a protection against GPs who distribute carry early in a fund cycle and then suffer losses later, leaving insufficient GP wealth to fund the final clawback.

## Capital Call Provisions and Default Remedies

Capital calls are the mechanism by which the GP draws down committed equity from LPs to fund investments or expenses. Agreements specify the required notice period for capital calls (typically 5-10 business days for project JVs; up to 30 days for institutional funds), the form of notice, and whether the GP can make multiple calls for a single investment.

LP default remedies for failure to fund a capital call are among the most heavily negotiated provisions in any partnership agreement. Common remedies available to non-defaulting parties include: (1) forced dilution, where the defaulting LP's interest is reduced, sometimes at a punitive ratio (e.g., the defaulting LP's interest is reduced by 150% of the unfunded amount); (2) loss of voting rights and distributions until the default is cured; (3) forced sale or buy-out of the defaulting LP's interest at a discount (commonly 80-90% of fair market value or book value); (4) the right of non-defaulting LPs to fund the shortfall and receive enhanced returns on the bridge capital; and (5) conversion to a loan bearing above-market interest.

Market practice generally gives non-defaulting parties a suite of remedies and significant discretion in their election. Courts have generally upheld punitive dilution provisions as enforceable, though the reasonableness of the dilution ratio can be challenged. GP default (e.g., failure to fund co-invest) triggers different remedies, typically including LP rights to remove the GP, suspend capital calls, or terminate the investment period.

The timing of capital call notices relative to the required funding date is also significant. Most institutional agreements require a minimum of 10 business days notice for capital calls, but may allow shorter notice (5 business days or less) for emergency calls — such as when a counterparty to an earnest money contract requires a deposit to extend a due diligence period. GPs should maintain close communication with LPs about the anticipated timing of capital calls to avoid defaults caused by LP administrative processing time.

## Removal of GP Provisions

LP rights to remove the GP are a fundamental investor protection. Most institutional agreements provide for two types of removal: removal for cause and removal without cause.

Removal for cause is typically triggered by events including: fraud or willful misconduct by the GP or its principals; material breach of the partnership agreement that is not cured within a specified period (commonly 30-60 days); bankruptcy or insolvency of the GP entity; criminal conviction of a key principal; and gross negligence resulting in material harm to the partnership. Removal for cause generally results in forfeiture of unpaid promote and, in some agreements, recovery of previously paid carry.

Removal without cause (sometimes called "no-fault removal") requires a higher LP approval threshold — typically 66.7% to 75% of LP interests — and does not result in promote forfeiture. Rather, the departing GP is typically paid its accrued, earned promote but loses future promote rights. The replacement GP must be approved by a similar supermajority.

Removal for cause is a unilateral GP protection against abusive LP behavior; removal without cause is a protection against GP underperformance. The interplay of these provisions with the key person clause (below) determines the full governance structure of the partnership.

The process for removal must be clearly defined. A removal that is procedurally defective — for example, where the required LP consent threshold was not properly obtained, or where inadequate notice was given — may be challenged by the GP in court. Well-drafted agreements specify the required vote threshold, the timing and form of notice, the transition obligations of the departing GP, and what happens to pending transactions during the transition period.

## Key Person Clauses

A key person clause suspends the GP's right to make new investments or call additional capital if one or more designated key individuals leave the GP organization, are incapacitated, or can no longer devote a required minimum percentage of their professional time to the fund. Key persons are named individuals — typically the most senior investment professionals — whose involvement is essential to the LP's investment decision.

When a key person event is triggered, the partnership typically enters a "suspension period" during which capital calls are suspended and the GP cannot close new investments. LPs then vote within a specified period (commonly 90-180 days) on whether to elect to dissolve the fund, continue with the existing team, or approve a replacement. A majority or supermajority of LP interests is required to continue without the key person.

Negotiation points include: the number of key persons required (losing any one vs. losing a specified percentage); the minimum time dedication threshold; whether death or disability is treated differently from voluntary departure; and whether a key person event triggers a removal right. GPs prefer narrow key person definitions (few named individuals, low time-dedication thresholds) while LPs prefer broader definitions capturing the full senior investment team.

The time dedication threshold is a particularly nuanced point. A key person who is "spending less than 50% of their professional time on this fund" may be spending that time on other funds managed by the same GP — which is entirely legitimate and does not necessarily harm fund management. LPs should consider whether the key person clause is meant to address personal departure from the firm (which clearly harms fund management) versus time allocation among multiple funds (which may not). Most institutional agreements focus on the individual's departure from the GP organization rather than on time allocation, which is harder to measure.

## GP Co-Investment Requirements

Most institutional LP agreements require the GP to contribute a minimum amount of co-investment alongside LPs to ensure alignment of interests. GP co-invest is typically expressed as a percentage of total fund commitments or total invested capital — commonly 1-5% for institutional funds, and often higher (5-20%) for project-level JVs where the GP is a developer with direct control over project execution.

GP co-investment contributions receive the same economic treatment as LP capital, including the preferred return and pro-rata distributions through the waterfall. The promote is calculated on top of this co-invest. A key question is whether the GP's co-invest is funded in cash (preferred by LPs, as it demonstrates real skin in the game) or whether it can be offset by fees, contributed services, or waived management fees. LPs increasingly require cash co-invest, particularly in higher-risk strategies.

Some agreements allow the GP to fund co-invest with a subscription loan secured by its partnership interest, which LPs view as reducing alignment. The trend in the post-2020 market has been toward requiring full cash co-invest for GP principals at the fund level, particularly in larger institutional vehicles.

Co-invest at the fund level must be distinguished from GP co-invest at the deal level. In some structures, the GP entity invests in the fund as an LP (fund-level co-invest) while individual principals are required to co-invest separately at the deal level or in the GP carry vehicle. Disaggregating these streams for both economic and tax purposes requires careful documentation in both the fund agreement and any side letters with principals.
