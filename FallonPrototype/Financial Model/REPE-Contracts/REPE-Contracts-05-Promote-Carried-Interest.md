# Reference Document 05: Promote / Carried Interest Structures
## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Carried interest — known as "promote" in real estate private equity — is the GP's share of investment profits above a specified return threshold. It is the primary mechanism by which real estate fund managers and deal sponsors are compensated for performance, and it is the central economic provision around which all other fund terms orbit. The structure of carried interest determines alignment of interests between GP and LP, timing of GP compensation, and the behavior incentives embedded in the investment vehicle. Getting promote structures right is critical to both attracting institutional capital and building a durable investment management business.

## European vs. American Waterfall Structures

The most fundamental structural choice in a multi-asset fund is whether the waterfall operates on an aggregate fund basis (European waterfall) or a deal-by-deal basis (American waterfall). This choice has profound implications for the GP's cash flow timing and the LP's protection against clawback risk.

A European waterfall requires that all LP capital across all investments — including capital invested in losing deals — be returned before any carry is paid. Additionally, the preferred return accrues across the entire portfolio before carry is calculated. Only after all capital is returned and the aggregate preferred return is satisfied does the GP begin to receive carry. The GP's cash flow from carry is therefore deferred until late in the fund's life, often for 7-10 years into a 10-year fund. European waterfalls are strongly LP-favorable and are the market standard in European private equity and, increasingly, in U.S. institutional real estate funds.

An American waterfall pays carry on a deal-by-deal basis. When an individual asset is sold and generates profits above the required return on that specific investment, the GP receives carry on that deal's profits immediately — without waiting for losses on other portfolio assets to be offset. This is strongly GP-favorable for cash flow purposes. The inherent risk is "over-distribution" of carry — if early-exiting profitable deals produce carry for the GP but later deals in the same fund generate losses, the GP will have received more carry than it was entitled to on a net portfolio basis. The clawback provision (discussed below) is the LP's protection against this risk.

Many institutional U.S. real estate funds use a modified American waterfall that includes deal-by-deal carry distributions but requires the GP to establish a carry escrow (typically 30-35% of carry received) to fund potential clawback obligations. This hybrid approach gives the GP earlier access to carry cash flow while providing LPs with practical clawback security.

The current institutional market trend (2020-2025) has moved definitively toward European waterfall structures for larger institutional funds, while American waterfalls persist in smaller funds, deal-by-deal JVs, and funds where the GP has sufficient leverage to resist LP demands.

## Multi-Tier Promote Structures

Multi-tier promotes create escalating GP carry percentages at higher performance thresholds, rewarding outperformance and creating strong incentives for the GP to push beyond minimum return hurdles.

A typical two-tier promote structure for a value-add fund:
- Tier 1: 80% LP / 20% GP above an 8% preferred return
- Tier 2: 70% LP / 30% GP above a 12% IRR (or 1.75x MOIC)

A typical three-tier structure for an opportunistic fund:
- Tier 1: 80% LP / 20% GP above a 10% preferred return
- Tier 2: 75% LP / 25% GP above a 15% IRR or 1.8x MOIC
- Tier 3: 65% LP / 35% GP above a 20% IRR or 2.0x MOIC

The economics of multi-tier promotes must be modeled carefully. Because the catch-up provision (see Document 01) allows the GP to "claw back" its promote percentage against all profits distributed to that point, the effective carry rate on total profits can be higher than the headline tier-1 percentage suggests. Modeling the promote at multiple return scenarios is essential for both LPs underwriting fund economics and GPs evaluating the commercial reasonableness of their fee structure.

In practice, there is significant market variation in multi-tier promote structures depending on asset class, strategy, fund size, and GP track record. Core-plus and core strategies typically carry lower promote rates (10-15% at a single tier) because returns are more predictable and the GP's management skill is less of a differentiator. Opportunistic and development strategies support higher multi-tier promotes (up to 35% at upper tiers) because the GP's execution skill is the primary return driver.

## Lookback Provisions

A lookback provision requires a final accounting of all capital contributed, all distributions received, and all fees paid at the conclusion of the fund's life to determine whether the GP received more or less carry than it was entitled to based on net portfolio performance. Lookback provisions are the GP's obligation counterpart to the LP's clawback right — in some structures, if the GP's carry entitlement on a lookback basis exceeds what was actually distributed, the GP is entitled to an additional payment.

More commonly, however, lookback provisions function as a mechanism to trigger the GP's clawback obligation. The lookback calculation at wind-up determines: (1) total capital contributed by all partners; (2) total distributions received, categorized by tier; (3) the GP's carried interest allocation relative to total profit on a fund-wide basis; (4) the GP's actual carry receipts during the fund's life; and (5) whether the GP is over- or under-carried. If over-carried, the clawback is triggered.

Lookback provisions typically survive termination of the fund for a specified period — commonly 3-5 years after the fund's final distribution — to allow final true-up calculations to be completed after all tax returns have been filed and all assets have been fully distributed. The lookback period should be clearly defined, as disputes can arise over the timing of the final accounting.

## GP Clawback Guarantees

A GP clawback guaranty is a personal or entity-level guarantee by the GP's principals to fund clawback obligations if the GP entity itself is unable to pay. Clawback guarantees are among the most contentious provisions in institutional fund negotiations.

LPs argue that a clawback obligation without a personal guarantee is worthless if the GP entity is insolvent or has been wound down by the time the clawback is triggered. GPs argue that personal guarantees expose principals to personal liability for fund performance outcomes that were not due to any personal misconduct. The compromise in market practice typically includes: (1) a pro-rata several (not joint) guarantee by named principals, typically limited to 100% of each principal's after-tax carry receipts; (2) an obligation limited to the period of the guarantor's active employment at the GP; and (3) a cap equal to the guarantor's proportionate share of carry received.

Some agreements structure the clawback guarantee as a "net of taxes" obligation — the guarantor's clawback is reduced to account for income taxes paid on the carry. This is significant: a principal who received $1 million of carry and paid $400,000 in taxes at a 40% effective rate would owe only $600,000 in a clawback, not $1 million. LPs prefer gross clawback obligations (the full $1 million) arguing that the GP chose when to recognize income and should bear the tax risk. This is heavily negotiated and often results in a compromise at some assumed tax rate applied to reduce the clawback obligation.

## Crystallization Events

Crystallization is the process by which earned but unrecognized carry becomes fixed, vested, and payable. In many fund structures, carry accrues throughout the life of the fund but is not paid until a crystallization event occurs. Common crystallization events include: (1) sale or other disposition of a portfolio investment; (2) the end of the investment period; (3) IPO or public listing of a portfolio company; (4) refinancing of an asset with return of equity to the fund; and (5) annual mark-to-market for open-ended funds.

In real estate private equity, crystallization most commonly occurs upon asset sale (a "back-ended" structure) or at regular intervals in open-ended core and core-plus funds (a "periodic crystallization" structure). Open-ended funds create unique challenges because assets are never sold, so carry must be calculated based on periodic appraisals. Periodic crystallization tied to appraised values means the GP's carry can be reduced or reversed if values subsequently decline — creating a "giveback" obligation that functions similarly to a clawback.

In periodic crystallization structures, the GP's exposure to giveback is typically managed through a high-water mark: the GP only receives carry on net asset value increases above the previously crystallized (high-water mark) level. If values decline below the high-water mark, the GP receives no carry until the fund recovers to and exceeds the previous peak.

## Distribution Timing and Mechanics

Distribution timing provisions determine when cash is distributed from the fund to partners and how different types of cash flows (operating income, refinancing proceeds, sales proceeds) are treated.

Operating cash flow is typically distributed quarterly or annually, after payment of fund expenses and any required reserves. The waterfall for operating distributions may differ from the waterfall for capital event distributions (sales and refinancings). In many structures, operating distributions are not subject to the preferred return tier (distributions are pro-rata between LP and GP based on capital contributions) while capital event distributions run through the full tiered waterfall.

The timing of promote payments relative to LP capital return is a key negotiation point. LPs prefer that no promote is paid until all LP capital is returned (a conservative interpretation of the European waterfall). GPs prefer to receive promote earlier, particularly in deal-by-deal structures. The trend in institutional markets is toward LP-protective timing, with no carry paid until capital return.

Distribution waterfalls must also address the sequencing of management fees. Some agreements allow unpaid management fees to accrue as a claim senior to LP capital — creating a situation where fee obligations effectively eat into LP capital in a poorly performing fund. LP-protective agreements require management fees to be paid from operations and not to accumulate as a senior obligation.

## Reinvestment Rights and Recycling Provisions

Recycling provisions allow the GP to re-deploy capital returned from early investments back into new investments during the investment period, effectively increasing the total invested capital above the fund's committed capital. Recycling is common in shorter-hold, higher-turnover strategies (development and flip strategies) and benefits the GP by allowing the fund to deploy more capital (and earn more management fees on invested capital) without requiring additional LP commitments.

Standard recycling provisions allow capital returned from investments during the investment period to be recycled into new investments, typically capped at an aggregate amount (e.g., 100-120% of committed capital can be invested in total across all investments including recycled capital). Some provisions allow only capital (not profits) to be recycled.

LPs scrutinize recycling provisions carefully because recycled capital effectively increases the GP's opportunity to earn management fees (if fees are calculated on invested capital) without LP approval. Additionally, recycled capital that is subsequently lost in a new investment creates compounding losses on the original capital. LPs may negotiate caps on recycling, exclusions for capital returned during the harvest period, and requirements that recycled capital be re-deployed within a specified period.

Reinvestment rights are a related concept specific to cash-flow distributions: the GP may have the right to reinvest distributed operating cash into follow-on investments in existing portfolio assets without a new capital call. This is particularly relevant for development deals where the initial investment is in land and early development costs, and subsequent phases require additional equity. LP consent requirements for reinvestment decisions are negotiation-dependent.

## Promote Vesting and Forfeiture

In many fund structures, the GP's principals do not have an immediate 100% vested interest in the promote — instead, promote rights vest over time or upon achievement of performance milestones. Vesting provisions protect LPs in the event the GP team loses key personnel, and they provide a retention incentive for GP principals.

Common vesting structures include: (1) cliff vesting after a specified period of service (e.g., 100% vesting after 3 years); (2) graduated vesting over the fund's investment period (e.g., 25% per year over 4 years); and (3) performance vesting tied to deployment or return milestones. Vesting typically applies at the entity level within the GP, governing the allocation of carry among principals and employees, rather than at the LP level — though some fund agreements condition the GP's carry entitlement on a minimum number of key persons remaining active.

Forfeiture of promote upon removal for cause (without right to accrued carry) versus removal without cause (with right to accrued carry) is discussed in Document 01. The definition of "accrued" carry in the forfeiture context is critical: is it carry that has been calculated and paid, carry on realized investments, or carry on the full portfolio including unrealized assets? These definitions can result in dramatically different economic outcomes.
