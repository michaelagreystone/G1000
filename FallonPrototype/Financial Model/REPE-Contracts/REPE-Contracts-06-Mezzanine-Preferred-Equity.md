# Reference Document 06: Mezzanine Financing and Preferred Equity
## Real Estate Private Equity Contract Provisions

---

## Overview

Mezzanine financing and preferred equity occupy the middle of the real estate capital stack, sitting between senior debt and common equity. These instruments allow borrowers to increase leverage beyond what senior lenders will provide, while offering lenders/investors higher yields than senior debt in exchange for subordinated credit risk. Mezzanine debt and preferred equity are structurally distinct instruments with different legal remedies, tax treatment, and documentation, but they serve similar economic functions. Understanding these instruments — and the contractual provisions that govern them — is essential for any practitioner working with leveraged real estate capital structures.

## Mezzanine Debt vs. Preferred Equity: The Core Distinction

Mezzanine debt is a loan secured not by a mortgage on real property but by a pledge of the equity interests in the entity that owns the real property. Because it is a pledge of equity (not a real property lien), mezzanine lenders can enforce their security interest through a UCC Article 9 foreclosure on the pledged equity, which is significantly faster and less expensive than a mortgage foreclosure. This speed of enforcement is the defining advantage of mezzanine debt over second-lien mortgage debt.

Preferred equity is not debt at all — it is an equity investment in the property-owning entity (or in an entity above it in the ownership stack) that has a priority claim on distributions, returns of capital, and certain governance rights over common equity. Preferred equity holders cannot foreclose in the way a mezzanine lender can; instead, their remedies on default are typically contractual: the right to trigger a forced sale, buy out the common equity at a formula price, or take over management of the entity.

The mezzanine debt / preferred equity distinction matters for several reasons. Tax treatment differs: interest on mezzanine debt is deductible by the borrower; preferred returns are not. Regulatory treatment differs: regulated lenders (insurance companies, pension funds) may have restrictions on holding equity positions that make mezzanine debt more attractive to those investors. REIT qualification can affect whether income from these instruments is considered "good REIT income." And foreclosure rights differ dramatically, as discussed below.

## Intercreditor Agreements

When a real estate transaction includes both senior debt and mezzanine debt, the rights and remedies of each lender are governed by an intercreditor agreement (ICA). The ICA is negotiated between the senior lender and the mezzanine lender (the borrower is typically not a party, though they may need to consent to certain provisions).

The intercreditor agreement addresses: (1) the respective positions of each lender in the capital stack; (2) the mezzanine lender's right to cure senior loan defaults on behalf of the borrower before the senior lender can accelerate or foreclose; (3) the mezzanine lender's right to purchase the senior loan at par (or at a defined price) in lieu of foreclosure by the senior lender; (4) restrictions on the mezzanine lender's enforcement actions (the "standstill" period); (5) the senior lender's approval rights over modifications to the mezzanine loan; and (6) what happens to each lender's position in the event of bankruptcy.

Senior lenders (particularly CMBS lenders) use standardized forms of intercreditor agreements developed by organizations including the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) and the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council (CREFC). These standardized forms are generally heavily weighted toward senior lender protections. Mezzanine lenders negotiating against CMBS intercreditor templates have limited room to move on structure but can negotiate on cure periods, purchase option pricing, and standstill duration.

The senior lender's approval of the mezzanine loan is typically required. Without that approval (and the executed ICA), the mezzanine lender's pledge of equity — which typically requires the consent of the entity owning the property — may violate the senior loan documents' transfer restrictions and trigger a default of the senior loan. The ICA gives the senior lender comfort that the mezzanine lender's enforcement actions will not interfere with the senior loan's collateral.

## Subordination Provisions

Subordination provisions in intercreditor agreements establish the priority of payment and remedies between senior and mezzanine (or between mezzanine and preferred equity). Subordination operates on two levels: payment subordination and lien (or enforcement) subordination.

Payment subordination means the subordinated lender cannot receive payments on its loan while the senior loan is in default (or in some structures, at any time without senior lender consent if certain financial tests are not met). "Hard" payment subordination prohibits any payment on the junior debt during the senior loan's existence regardless of whether the senior loan is in default. "Soft" payment subordination allows scheduled interest payments on the junior debt but prohibits principal repayments and acceleration until senior loan payoff. Most real estate intercreditor agreements use a form of soft subordination — mezzanine current interest continues to pay during the standstill period, but no principal or prepayment premium is payable without senior lender consent.

Enforcement subordination (standstill) is discussed below. The combination of payment subordination and enforcement standstill defines the mezzanine lender's window of practical action: they may receive current interest but cannot force a sale, foreclose, or accelerate the borrower during the standstill period.

## Standstill Agreements

A standstill (sometimes called a "standstill period" or "purchase option period") is the period during which the mezzanine lender agrees not to exercise foreclosure or other enforcement remedies against the pledged equity, giving the senior lender time to protect its collateral position. Standstill provisions are critical to senior lenders because aggressive mezzanine enforcement could disrupt the property-owning entity, trigger loan-to-own strategies, or interfere with senior loan workouts.

Typical standstill periods in CMBS-related intercreditor agreements run 90-180 days from the date of a mezzanine default (or senior default, depending on the trigger). During the standstill, the mezzanine lender may: (1) exercise any cure rights available to it under the intercreditor agreement (curing the senior loan default on behalf of the borrower); (2) exercise its purchase option to acquire the senior loan at par; and (3) negotiate with the borrower for voluntary resolution. What the mezzanine lender may not do during the standstill: foreclose on the pledged equity, take any action that would affect the property (which the senior lender's collateral), or exercise any rights over the property-owning entity's operations.

After the standstill expires, the mezzanine lender may proceed with a UCC foreclosure on the pledged equity. The UCC Article 9 foreclosure process for equity interests typically takes 30-45 additional days (after giving required notices), compared to 6-18 months for a mortgage foreclosure. This speed advantage is why mezzanine lenders accept standstill restrictions — even a 180-day standstill plus 45-day UCC process gives the mezzanine lender a faster remedy than a senior lender pursuing mortgage foreclosure.

## Purchase Option (Mezzanine Lender's Right to Acquire Senior Debt)

A purchase option in an intercreditor agreement gives the mezzanine lender the right to purchase the senior loan from the senior lender at par (outstanding principal plus accrued interest, fees, and costs) at any time following a senior loan default or during the standstill period. The purchase option converts the mezzanine lender into the senior lender, giving them first-priority lien rights and the full enforcement toolkit of the senior loan.

Purchase options are exercised when the mezzanine lender believes the property's value exceeds the senior loan balance, making it economically rational to acquire the senior position and then foreclose through the more powerful mortgage foreclosure route (as the new senior lender), rather than through the equity pledge route. In a distressed scenario where the mezzanine lender exercises a purchase option and then forecloses on the mortgage, the mezzanine lender becomes the property owner — a loan-to-own strategy.

The pricing of the purchase option is a negotiation point. At-par purchase options (principal plus accrued interest and costs) are market standard. Mezzanine lenders resist purchase options priced above par (e.g., including a prepayment premium owed to the senior lender), as this increases the cost of the loan-to-own strategy. CMBS intercreditor templates often include at-par purchase options as a standard feature.

## Conversion Rights

Conversion rights give a lender or preferred equity investor the right to convert their debt or preferred equity position into common equity under specified conditions. In real estate private equity, conversion rights are most commonly found in mezzanine or preferred equity instruments where the lender/investor wishes to participate in equity upside if the investment performs well.

A typical conversion right allows the mezzanine lender or preferred equity holder to convert their position into a specified percentage of the common equity in the property-owning entity, at a formula price, upon the occurrence of a trigger event (commonly maturity of the instrument without repayment, a change of control, or at the investor's election after a specified period). Conversion dilutes the common equity sponsor and may change the governance structure of the deal.

Conversion rights in real estate are less common than in venture or corporate private equity, because: (1) real estate equity is typically privately held in LLC or LP structures with complex existing governance; (2) the debt-to-equity conversion may trigger adverse tax events for existing partners; (3) lenders who convert to equity lose the legal protections of a creditor; and (4) real estate-focused institutional investors often prefer pure debt or pure equity positions to hybrid instruments that complicate reporting and risk management.

When conversion rights are included, the documentation must address: the conversion price or formula; the resulting ownership percentage; the governance rights of the converting party post-conversion; registration rights (in public vehicles); and tag-along and drag-along rights to give the converted equity holder liquidity pathways.

## Equity Kickers

An equity kicker is an additional economic benefit provided to a mezzanine lender or preferred equity investor on top of their stated interest or preferred return, designed to allow participation in property appreciation. Equity kickers are common in higher-risk mezzanine transactions where the lender accepts below-market current interest in exchange for upside participation.

Common forms of equity kickers include: (1) a profits interest (a share of profits above a hurdle, similar to a promote structure); (2) a warrant to purchase equity at a fixed price; (3) a participation in sales proceeds above a specified level (an "appreciation kicker"); and (4) a right to receive a percentage of any excess cash flow after debt service.

The economic structure of the kicker determines whether it is treated as debt (preserving the lender's creditor status) or equity (converting the arrangement to a joint venture) for tax, legal, and accounting purposes. Too generous a kicker — particularly one that gives the lender voting rights, decision-making authority, or a share of all profits from the outset — may cause the IRS to re-characterize the "debt" as equity, eliminating interest deductibility and potentially triggering partnership tax treatment.

## Payment-in-Kind (PIK) and Deferred Interest

PIK (payment-in-kind) interest is interest that, instead of being paid in cash, is added to the principal balance of the loan. PIK provisions allow borrowers to preserve cash flow during the early or lease-up phases of a project, while lenders continue to earn compound returns on an ever-growing principal balance.

PIK interest accrues daily and is added to the loan balance at specified intervals (monthly or quarterly). Because PIK interest compounds — the borrower pays interest on prior PIK interest additions — the effective cost of PIK financing is higher than the stated PIK rate. A loan with a 12% PIK rate compounds to an effective annual rate of approximately 12.68% with monthly compounding, which materially increases the ultimate repayment obligation.

From a loan underwriting perspective, PIK provisions require lenders to stress-test repayment scenarios against the maximum possible PIK accrual. If the loan reaches maturity with a PIK balance that the property cannot support (because the LTV has increased materially due to PIK accrual), the borrower may face a maturity default even if the property performs as underwritten. Some PIK structures include a "PIK toggle" — the borrower may elect, period by period, whether to pay interest in cash or PIK — giving flexibility to manage cash flow while preserving the option to pay down principal.

Intercreditor agreements must address PIK treatment: senior lenders generally require that any PIK accrual on the mezzanine loan be treated as a prohibited distribution (since it effectively defers a cash obligation to the mezzanine lender rather than paying it), or they require that PIK accrual be subordinated to current-pay senior interest.

## Redemption Rights

Redemption rights give a preferred equity investor the right to require the issuer (the borrower or sponsor) to repurchase the preferred equity at a specified price and time. Mandatory redemption rights function like a loan maturity: at the specified date, the sponsor must pay off the preferred equity investor. Optional redemption rights give the sponsor the right to repay early (call the preferred equity), typically at a premium during a specified "call protection" period.

Preferred equity redemption is priced at: (1) original principal amount; (2) plus accrued and unpaid preferred return (including any PIK accruals); (3) plus any applicable prepayment premium; and (4) plus any equity kicker entitlement. The total redemption price must be fully funded by the project's available cash (refinancing proceeds, sales proceeds, or new equity) at the time of redemption.

If the sponsor cannot redeem at the required date, the preferred equity investor's remedies typically escalate: interest or preferred return rate increases (often to a default rate of 5-15% above the regular rate); voting rights shift to give the preferred investor control of the entity; and ultimately, the preferred investor may trigger a forced sale of the property (a "drag-along" right to force the common equity sponsor to sell the asset to fund the redemption).

Forced sale rights are the ultimate enforcement remedy for preferred equity investors who lack the mortgage foreclosure or UCC remedies available to mezzanine lenders. For this reason, the forced sale right is the critical provision in any preferred equity instrument: it must be clearly defined (trigger event, notice requirements, sale process standards), enforceable under applicable state law (Delaware, New York, and other states treat forced sale provisions in LLC operating agreements differently), and not subject to equitable defenses that could delay its exercise.

## Intercreditor Treatment in Bankruptcy

The bankruptcy context reveals the full limitations and advantages of mezzanine debt versus preferred equity. Mezzanine debt, as a loan obligation, benefits from the automatic stay in bankruptcy proceedings — but also faces the risk of being "crammed down" along with the senior debt in a reorganization plan. Preferred equity, being equity, is subordinated to all debt claims in a bankruptcy and typically receives nothing in a reorganization unless all senior creditors are paid in full.

Importantly, a UCC foreclosure on pledged equity must be completed before the borrower files for bankruptcy — once the automatic stay is in place, no creditor can take any enforcement action without court approval. This is why mezzanine lenders move quickly to foreclose upon default and why standstill periods are designed to be short enough to allow foreclosure before a bankruptcy filing becomes likely. "Springing" UCC foreclosures, where the mezzanine lender has already given notice and commenced the UCC process before the standstill expires, are a tactical device to accelerate enforcement.

Intercreditor agreements should contain express provisions governing the allocation of bankruptcy litigation costs between senior and mezzanine lenders, the mezzanine lender's right to bid at any bankruptcy sale, and the senior lender's right to control the reorganization process (including plan approval, DIP financing, and cash collateral use).
