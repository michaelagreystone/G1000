RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Proceed with due diligence. The 12.8% projected LP IRR falls below our
14-15% target for development deals in secondary markets. Consider:
- Negotiating land price reduction
- Value engineering to reduce hard costs
- Seeking more favorable debt terms
- Adjusting unit mix for higher rent premium
