Nashville Mixed-Use Development — The Gulch District
Project Overview: 300-Unit Multifamily + 20,000 SF Ground-Floor Retail

Site Description:
The project occupies a 3.2-acre infill site at the southern edge of Nashville's Gulch district, one of the city's most dynamic mixed-use neighborhoods. The site had previously been used as surface parking and was acquired off-market through an existing landowner relationship. Zoning allowed for by-right development up to 8 stories, which we utilized fully for the residential tower with a 2-story podium base incorporating the retail component. The site benefits from immediate proximity to the 12 South neighborhood, direct access to the Gulch pedestrian greenway, and strong walk scores above 85.

Business Plan Rationale:
Nashville's multifamily market was experiencing significant in-migration driven by healthcare, technology, and corporate relocations. At underwriting, Nashville was absorbing approximately 8,000 units annually against deliveries of 6,500, creating a structural undersupply in Class A product. The Gulch submarket specifically commanded a 15-20% rent premium over metro averages due to walkability and entertainment proximity. The ground-floor retail was designed for experiential tenants (restaurant, fitness, coffee) to create amenity value for residents rather than serve as a standalone profit center.

Key Assumptions at Underwriting:
Average monthly rent was projected at $1.82/sf ($1,638/mo on 900sf average units). We underwrote to a 5.0% exit cap rate based on trailing 12-month transactions in the submarket. Hard construction costs were projected at $268/sf, reflecting Nashville's favorable labor costs relative to coastal markets. Total project cost was budgeted at $98.5M, with a 65% LTC construction facility at SOFR + 285bps. LP equity required was $34.5M at a 90/10 split with an 8% preferred return and 20% GP promote above pref.

Return Metrics Achieved:
The project delivered a 16.8% levered LP IRR and 1.95x equity multiple over a 4.5-year hold. Profit on cost came in at 32%, with a development spread of 145 basis points (6.45% yield on cost vs 5.0% exit cap rate). NOI at stabilization reached $6.2M, and we exited at a 4.85% cap rate — 15bps tighter than underwriting — driven by strong institutional demand for Nashville multifamily in 2024.

Lessons Learned:
Construction costs came in 6% over budget ($284/sf vs $268/sf projected) primarily due to steel price escalation during the 2022 supply chain disruptions. The retail component leased more slowly than projected (14 months vs 8 months) because experiential retailers were cautious post-COVID. However, residential lease-up was completed 3 months ahead of schedule (13 months vs 16 projected), which more than offset the retail delay. The key takeaway was that Nashville multifamily demand remained robust even during a period of elevated deliveries, and that the Gulch location premium held. We would not change the underwriting approach for a similar deal today, though we would increase the construction contingency from 5% to 7% to account for materials volatility.
