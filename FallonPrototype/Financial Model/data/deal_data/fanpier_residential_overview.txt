Fan Pier Residential — Boston Seaport District
Project Overview: Luxury Condominium Development (Merchant Developer Model)

Site Description:
Fan Pier Residential is a 12-story luxury condominium tower located on Fan Pier in Boston's Seaport District, commanding unobstructed waterfront views of Boston Harbor. The project sits on a 1.8-acre site within the larger Fan Pier master plan, one of the most significant waterfront development sites in the northeastern United States. The site benefits from direct harbor access, proximity to the Institute of Contemporary Art, and walking distance to the Financial District via the Seaport Boulevard bridge. The land was part of Fallon's master development agreement with the Massport Authority, with the residential parcel allocated at $22M based on the master plan land disposition framework.

Merchant Developer Business Model:
Unlike the typical hold-and-rent model used for multifamily apartments, Fan Pier Residential followed a merchant developer (for-sale) model. Units were pre-sold and sold upon delivery, with the goal of achieving maximum gross margin on the sellout rather than generating ongoing rental income. This model is capital-intensive during construction but produces a single, concentrated return at sellout rather than distributed cash flows over a hold period. The Seaport location and luxury positioning justified the for-sale strategy — Boston's high-end condo market has consistently demonstrated strong absorption for waterfront product, with price resilience even during market downturns.

Unit Mix and Pricing:
The project comprised 106 units across a mix of one-bedroom (32 units, avg 850sf at $1,150/sf), two-bedroom (48 units, avg 1,250sf at $1,350/sf), three-bedroom (20 units, avg 1,800sf at $1,500/sf), and penthouse units (6 units, avg 2,800sf at $1,850/sf). Weighted average price per square foot across all units was approximately $1,375/sf. Total projected sellout revenue was $178.5M. Pre-sales began 18 months before delivery, and we achieved 45% pre-sold by construction start — a strong indicator of market demand.

Construction Timeline and Costs:
Construction duration was 28 months from groundbreaking to certificate of occupancy, which was 2 months longer than the original 26-month schedule due to winter weather delays and a concrete finishing subcontractor change. Total hard construction cost was $465/sf — premium pricing reflecting luxury finishes (marble countertops, European appliances, floor-to-ceiling windows, private balconies on every unit), union labor, and waterfront structural requirements including deep pile foundations. Soft costs were 32% of hard, elevated by the luxury specifications requiring extended design development, Massport coordination, and extensive environmental permitting for the waterfront site. Total development cost including land was $142.8M.

Sellout Performance and Gross Margin:
Sellout was completed over 14 months from first closing to final unit sold, which was faster than the 18-month projection. Final aggregate sellout revenue was $183.2M — 2.6% above the initial $178.5M projection, driven by price escalation in the penthouse and three-bedroom segments where we increased asking prices twice during the pre-sale period. Gross margin on sellout was 28.3% ($183.2M revenue - $142.8M total cost = $40.4M profit / $142.8M cost). This exceeded the 24% gross margin underwritten at project inception. The project was financed with a 60% LTC construction facility and 40% equity, with LP equity at a 90/10 split. LP IRR delivered was 22.4% with a 1.68x equity multiple on a compressed 3.5-year total timeline (18 months pre-development + 28 months construction + 14 months sellout, with substantial overlap between construction completion and sellout activity).
