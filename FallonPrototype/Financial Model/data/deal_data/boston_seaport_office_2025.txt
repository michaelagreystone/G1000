MARKET CONTEXT
--------------
Seaport Lab Market:
- Vacancy: 8.5% (vs 18% overall Boston office)
- Asking Rents: $90-110/SF NNN
- Lab conversion premium: 25-35% over traditional office

Recent Comparable Trades:
1. 101 Seaport: $1,150/SF (2024)
2. One Harbor Point: $1,025/SF (2023)
3. Pier 4 Life Science: $985/SF (2024)

RISK ASSESSMENT
---------------
High Risks:
1. Union labor costs (+35% vs national)
2. Permitting timeline (12-18 months typical)
3. Interest rate exposure on floating debt
4. Life science demand cyclicality

Medium Risks:
1. Competition from lab conversions
2. NNN expense recovery collection
3. Tenant credit quality
4. Construction cost escalation

Mitigants:
1. Pre-lease requirement before start
2. Experienced Boston GC relationship
3. Lab-flexible design reduces obsolescence
4. Ground lease reduces basis

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Proceed to final pre-development. The 13.2% LP IRR is acceptable for 
gateway market office given the life science premium and institutional
quality. Key milestones:

1. Achieve 40% pre-lease commitment
2. Lock GMP contract with 3% escalation cap
3. Secure construction loan commitment
4. Finalize ground lease terms with BPDA

Investment Committee approval required for final commitment of 
$20.5M GP equity.
