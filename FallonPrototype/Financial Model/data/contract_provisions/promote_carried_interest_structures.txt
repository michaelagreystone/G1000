PROMOTE AND CARRIED INTEREST STRUCTURES IN REAL ESTATE PRIVATE EQUITY
Comprehensive Reference for Development Deal Structuring

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: WATERFALL DISTRIBUTION MECHANICS — DEEP DIVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The waterfall distribution structure is the economic engine of a real estate private equity deal. It determines how every dollar of cash flow and exit proceeds is allocated between the investors (LPs) and the manager (GP). Understanding the nuances is critical because small structural differences can shift millions of dollars between the parties.

IRR-Based Hurdle Calculations:

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows (contributions and distributions) equal to zero. In a waterfall context, the IRR is calculated on the LP's actual cash-on-cash flows — the dates and amounts of capital contributions (outflows) and distributions (inflows). The IRR implicitly accounts for timing — a dollar returned in year 1 is worth more than a dollar returned in year 5.

Common IRR hurdle structures:
- Single hurdle: 8% IRR → 80/20 split above the hurdle
- Two-tier: 8% → 80/20; 15% → 70/30
- Three-tier: 8% → 80/20; 12% → 70/30; 18% → 60/40
- Four-tier: 8% → 80/20; 12% → 70/30; 18% → 60/40; 25% → 50/50

The marginal vs. cumulative distinction is critical: In a marginal (or "incremental") waterfall, the promote percentage applies only to the profits in that specific tier. In a cumulative waterfall, once a higher tier is reached, the promote percentage applies to ALL profits, not just the marginal profits in that tier. Cumulative waterfalls are significantly more GP-favorable.

Example — $10M LP equity, 5-year hold, $25M total distributions:

Marginal Waterfall:
- Return of capital: $10M to LP
- 8% pref on $10M over 5 years: ~$4.69M (compounded) to LP
- Profits from 8% to 12% IRR tier: split 80/20
- Profits from 12% to 18% IRR tier: split 70/30
- Profits above 18% IRR: split 60/40

Cumulative Waterfall:
- If total return exceeds 18% IRR, ALL profits above return of capital are split 60/40
- This means the GP's effective promote on the deal is much higher

Virtually all institutional LP agreements use marginal (incremental) waterfalls. Cumulative waterfalls are seen in older fund documents and smaller, less-institutional deals.

GP Catch-Up Mechanics — Detailed Example:

Assume: $10M LP equity, 8% preferred return, 20% promote, 100% catch-up.

Step 1: Return LP's $10M capital → LP receives $10M
Step 2: Pay LP 8% preferred return → LP receives $4.69M (8% compounded over 5 years)
Step 3: GP catch-up → GP receives 100% of next distributions until GP has received 20% of total profits
  - Total profits distributed so far: $4.69M (all to LP as pref)
  - GP target: 20% of total profits = 20% × ($4.69M / 80%) = $1.17M
  - GP receives $1.17M with zero going to LP during catch-up
Step 4: Remaining profits split 80/20 (LP/GP)

Without the catch-up, the GP would only receive 20% of profits above the 8% pref — they'd miss the promote on the first $4.69M of profits. The catch-up ensures the GP ultimately receives 20% of ALL profits.

Partial catch-up (e.g., 50%): During the catch-up phase, distributions are split 50/50 (50% to GP, 50% to LP) instead of 100% to GP. This softens the impact on LP cash flow during the catch-up period but extends the catch-up duration.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: MULTI-TIER PROMOTE — MARKET STANDARD STRUCTURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The most sophisticated real estate PE deals use multi-tier promotes with different GP percentages at different return hurdles. These structures incentivize the GP to maximize returns because their marginal profit share increases at each tier.

Standard Three-Tier Development Deal Promote (2025 Market):

Tier 1: Return of Capital + 8% Preferred Return
- 100% to LP until LP has received their invested capital plus an 8% compounded annual return
- GP receives no promote in this tier

Tier 2: 8% to 15% IRR — 80/20 Split
- After the 8% pref is satisfied, the next tranche of profits is split 80% LP / 20% GP
- This is the "base promote" tier — the GP earns 20% of profits between the 8% floor and 15% ceiling

Tier 3: 15% to 22% IRR — 70/30 Split
- Profits attributable to returns between 15% and 22% IRR are split 70% LP / 30% GP
- The GP's marginal promote increases to 30%, incentivizing outperformance

Tier 4: Above 22% IRR — 60/40 Split
- All profits above the 22% IRR hurdle are split 60% LP / 40% GP
- The GP's maximum marginal promote is 40% — this is the "superstar" tier

This structure is typical for experienced GPs with established track records managing $500M+ development portfolios. First-time GPs or GPs with limited track records typically start with a simpler two-tier structure (80/20 up to 15%, 70/30 above 15%).

MOIC-Based Promotes:

Some investors prefer MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) hurdles because they are simpler to calculate and less sensitive to timing manipulation. MOIC = total distributions / total invested capital.

Standard MOIC structure:
- Below 1.5x MOIC: no promote (LP receives 100% of distributions after return of capital)
- 1.5x to 2.0x MOIC: 20% promote
- 2.0x to 2.5x MOIC: 30% promote
- Above 2.5x MOIC: 40% promote

MOIC vs. IRR comparison: A 2.0x MOIC over 3 years implies approximately a 26% IRR. The same 2.0x MOIC over 7 years implies approximately a 10.4% IRR. MOIC hurdles don't incentivize quick flips — the GP earns the same promote regardless of hold period. This can be an advantage (longer-term value creation) or disadvantage (no incentive to return capital quickly) depending on LP preferences.

Hybrid IRR/MOIC Promotes:

The most LP-protective structure uses both IRR and MOIC hurdles, requiring BOTH to be met before the GP earns the next tier of promote. This prevents the GP from gaming the waterfall through timing optimization.

Example: GP earns the Tier 2 promote (20%) only if BOTH of the following conditions are met:
- LP IRR ≥ 12%
- LP MOIC ≥ 1.5x

This dual-hurdle structure is increasingly common in large institutional funds.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: LOOKBACK, CLAWBACK, AND TRUE-UP PROVISIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Lookback Provision:

At the end of the fund's life (or at specified interim dates), all cumulative distributions across all investments are aggregated and the waterfall is recalculated as if it were a single European (whole-of-fund) waterfall. If the GP received more promote under the deal-by-deal calculation than they would have under the whole-of-fund calculation, the GP must return the excess.

The lookback protects LPs against the scenario where early deals perform well (generating promote for the GP) but later deals perform poorly (generating losses for the LP). Without a lookback, the GP keeps the promote from early winners even though the fund's overall performance may be mediocre.

Lookback Mechanics:
1. Calculate actual total distributions made to GP across all deals
2. Recalculate what GP would have received under a European waterfall on the entire fund
3. If (1) > (2), the difference is the clawback amount
4. GP must return the clawback amount to the LP within 60-90 days

Escrow/Holdback:

To ensure the GP has funds available to satisfy a potential clawback, some agreements require a portion of each promote distribution to be held in escrow. Common structures:
- 20-30% of each promote payment is held in escrow
- Escrow is released in annual installments over the fund's remaining life
- Upon fund termination, the escrow is trued up against any clawback obligation
- Excess escrow (after clawback satisfaction) is released to the GP

Personal Guarantee of Clawback:

Institutional LPs increasingly require the GP's individual principals to personally guarantee the clawback obligation. Without a personal guarantee, the GP entity may lack sufficient assets to fund the clawback (especially if the principals have taken distributions from the GP entity for personal use). The guarantee typically covers 100% of the clawback obligation but may be reduced over time as the fund matures and the clawback risk decreases.

Tax Protection:

Clawbacks create a tax problem: the GP paid income tax on the promote when it was received, but now must return (some of) the promote. The GP shouldn't have to return more after-tax dollars than they received. Most modern agreements address this with a "net-of-tax" clawback: the GP's clawback obligation is reduced by the amount of taxes they actually paid on the promote distributions. The tax rate used is typically the actual rate paid, documented by tax returns, not an assumed rate.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: DISTRIBUTION TIMING AND REINVESTMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Distribution Frequency:

Operating cash flow distributions are typically made quarterly. Exit/disposition proceeds are distributed within 30-60 days of the exit closing. Some agreements require a minimum cash reserve before distributions can be made (typically 3-6 months of operating expenses plus debt service).

Reinvestment Rights (Recycling):

Some fund agreements allow the GP to reinvest (recycle) capital returned from early exits into new investments rather than distributing it to LPs. Recycling increases the fund's total invested capital and potential returns but also extends the fund's life and delays LP liquidity.

Common recycling provisions:
- Recycling window: 2-3 years from initial closing (no recycling after the investment period ends)
- Recycling cap: 100-150% of committed capital (limits the total amount that can be invested)
- LP consent: Some agreements require LP advisory committee consent for recycling
- Promote impact: Recycled capital is treated as new capital for waterfall purposes — the GP doesn't earn promote on recycled capital until the full preferred return is earned on the recycled amount

Mandatory Distributions:

Some agreements require the GP to distribute refinancing proceeds to LPs rather than reinvesting them. This is LP-protective because refinancing proceeds are a form of return of capital — the LP gets their money back (partially) without a sale event. The GP may resist mandatory distribution of refinancing proceeds because it reduces the capital available for ongoing operations and reserves.

Distribution Waterfall During Operations vs. Exit:

Some waterfalls have different structures for operating distributions (quarterly cash flow) vs. exit distributions (sale proceeds). A common structure:
- Operating distributions: split pro rata by ownership percentage (e.g., 90/10 LP/GP) with no waterfall — the waterfall only applies to exit proceeds
- Exit distributions: full waterfall calculation with preferred return, catch-up, and tiered promote

This structure gives the GP current income from operations (at their 10% ownership share) while reserving the promote calculation for exit events where the total return can be definitively calculated.

SECTION 5: DEVELOPER FEE AND GP ECONOMICS BEYOND PROMOTE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The promote is NOT the GP's only source of economics in a development deal. Understanding the full picture of GP compensation is critical for both structuring and negotiating.

Developer Fee: 3-5% of total project cost, paid during construction from the project budget. For a $75M project, a 4% developer fee = $3M. The developer fee is a line item in the project budget that is funded by the construction loan (and therefore by LP equity). Some portion of the developer fee is typically deferred — not paid in cash during construction but instead contributed as GP co-invest (reducing the GP's out-of-pocket equity requirement).

Construction Management Fee: If the GP entity also provides construction management services, they may charge a separate fee of 3-5% of hard construction costs. This is less common in institutional deals where a third-party general contractor provides this service.

Property Management Fee: 3-4% of effective gross income, paid monthly from operating revenue. For a 200-unit project at $1,700/month average rent, annual EGI = ~$4M, and a 3% management fee = $120K/year.

Acquisition Fee: 1-2% of acquisition cost, paid at closing. Common in value-add deals; less common in ground-up development (where the developer fee serves a similar purpose).

Asset Management Fee: 1-2% of committed equity or invested capital, paid annually. Compensates the GP for ongoing oversight, reporting, and strategic management. Some agreements tie the asset management fee to performance — reduced or eliminated if returns fall below the preferred return hurdle.

GP Co-Investment Offset: Many deals allow the GP to satisfy part of their co-investment requirement by deferring the developer fee. Example: GP co-invest requirement is $5M (10% of $50M total equity). The GP defers $3M of their $4M developer fee and only contributes $2M in cash. The deferred fee is treated as GP equity for waterfall purposes. This mechanism allows the GP to have meaningful "skin in the game" without requiring significant personal capital.

Fee-Related Issues in Negotiation:

1. Fee netting against promote: Some LP agreements require that all GP fees (except property management, which is a market-rate expense) be netted against the GP's promote. This means the GP doesn't receive their promote until the LP has been "made whole" for the fees they funded through the project budget.

2. Fee on committed vs. invested capital: Asset management fees calculated on committed capital are GP-favorable (they earn fees on capital not yet invested). Fees on invested capital are LP-favorable.

3. Fee offset for third-party services: If the GP hires a third-party property manager (instead of self-managing), some agreements credit the GP for the management fee savings — the GP receives the difference between the third-party fee and the fee they would have earned self-managing. This is controversial and should be explicitly addressed.
