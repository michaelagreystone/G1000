8.3 DEFINITIONS

"Capital Contribution" means, with respect to any Member, the aggregate 
amount of cash or property contributed by such Member to the Company 
pursuant to Article 4.

"Distributable Cash" means, for any period, the excess of (i) cash 
receipts from operations, capital events, and refinancings over 
(ii) operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures, and 
reasonable reserves as determined by the Operating Member.

"Internal Rate of Return" or "IRR" means the annual rate of return that, 
when used to discount all Capital Contributions and distributions to 
their present values as of the date of the initial Capital Contribution, 
causes the sum of the present values of all distributions to equal the 
sum of the present values of all Capital Contributions. IRR shall be 
calculated using the XIRR function methodology.

"Preferred Return" means a cumulative, compounded annual return of 
eight percent (8.0%) on unreturned Capital Contributions.

8.4 TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS

(a) Operating Distributions: The Operating Member shall cause the Company 
to distribute available Distributable Cash from operations within 
forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter.

(b) Capital Event Distributions: Distributable Cash from any capital 
event (sale, refinancing, or recapitalization) shall be distributed 
within ten (10) business days following receipt by the Company.

(c) Tax Distributions: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall 
distribute to each Member, within thirty (30) days following the end of 
each taxable year, an amount sufficient to enable such Member to pay 
federal and state income taxes on its allocable share of Company taxable 
income for such year, calculated at the assumed rate of forty percent 
(40%).

8.5 CLAWBACK PROVISIONS

(a) GP Clawback: Upon final liquidation of the Company, if the Operating 
Member has received aggregate distributions in excess of the amounts to 
which it would have been entitled had all distributions been made in a 
single distribution upon liquidation in accordance with Section 8.1, the 
Operating Member shall promptly return such excess to the Company for 
redistribution to the Investor Member.

(b) LP Clawback: To the extent the Investor Member has received 
distributions in excess of the amounts to which it would have been 
entitled pursuant to Section 8.1 upon final liquidation, such excess 
amounts (net of taxes paid by the Investor Member attributable to such 
excess) shall be returned to the Company.

GP: $2,500,000

Cumulative to LP needed for 8% IRR: ~$32,100,000
Amount from Tier 2: $9,600,000 to LP

Tier 3 - GP Catch-Up:
GP receives until GP total = 20% of (Tier 2 + Tier 3)

Remaining: $8,000,000

Tier 4 - Residual Split:
LP: $8,000,000 × 80% = $6,400,000
GP: $8,000,000 × 20% = $1,600,000

FINAL DISTRIBUTIONS:
LP Total: $22,500,000 + $9,600,000 + $6,400,000 = $38,500,000
GP Total: $2,500,000 + $2,400,000 + $1,600,000 = $6,500,000
