EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boston remains one of the most resilient and sought-after real estate markets in
the United States, characterized by supply constraints, strong institutional
employment anchors (healthcare, biotech, education, financial services), and
premium pricing. The city's multifamily sector shows signs of stabilization after
pandemic-era volatility, while the office market continues to navigate structural
changes from hybrid work adoption.
