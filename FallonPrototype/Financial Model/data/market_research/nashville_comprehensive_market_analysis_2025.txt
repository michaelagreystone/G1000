EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nashville has transformed from a regional center to a nationally significant
market driven by healthcare, entertainment/hospitality, technology, and corporate
relocations. The city experienced a historic supply wave in 2023-2024 that is
now tapering, positioning the market for recovery in 2025-2027. The hotel sector
faces near-term challenges from oversupply but long-term fundamentals remain
strong given Nashville's unique tourism appeal.

SECTION 1: MULTIFAMILY MARKET ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1.1 HISTORICAL RENT AND OCCUPANCY TRENDS (2019-2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year    Avg Rent/Unit   YoY Change    Vacancy Rate    Net Absorption
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019    $1,385          +4.2%         5.5%            9,200 units
2020    $1,410          +1.8%         6.8%            5,500 units
2021    $1,525          +8.2%         5.2%            14,500 units
2022    $1,750          +14.7%        6.5%            8,200 units
2023    $1,695          -3.1%         9.5%            7,800 units
2024    $1,660          -2.1%         8.5%            11,006 units (record)
2025    $1,639          -1.3%         8.0%            8,900 (proj)

Key Observation: Nashville saw extreme rent growth in 2021-2022 (+24% cumulative)
followed by correction as massive supply delivered. 2024 marked an inflection
point with record absorption finally catching supply.

1.2 SUPPLY CYCLE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year    Units Delivered    Units Under Const    Inventory Growth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2022    8,500              18,500               4.8%
2023    11,800             17,200               6.2%
2024    13,027             13,600               6.8%
2025    7,569 (proj)       9,500                3.8%
2026    5,500 (proj)       6,000 (est)          2.5%

Critical Turning Point: Construction starts have declined dramatically. The
2023-2024 delivery peak (nearly 25,000 units in two years, double the 10-year
average) is giving way to a much lighter 2025-2027 pipeline.

1.3 SUBMARKET PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (Q3 2025)

Mt. Juliet/Lebanon     $1,380          7.8%      -0.5%         Growth corridor

Downtown/Gulch Note: Absorbed 3,871 units over past year (one-third of total
market absorption) despite 9.6% vacancy, indicating strong underlying demand
for urban living when priced competitively.

in the near term.

2025    65.2%        $175        $114        -5.0% (est)

Key Challenge: Occupancy and RevPAR declined in 2024-2025 as supply growth
(3.6%) outpaced demand growth (1.6%). This marks the first sustained decline
since the COVID recovery.

2.3 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE (2025)
