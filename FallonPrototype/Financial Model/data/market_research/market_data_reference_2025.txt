Updated: Q4 2025 | Sources: CBRE, JLL, Marcus & Millichap, Avison Young, FRED, Zillow Research

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: CHARLOTTE, NC — MULTIFAMILY MARKET DATA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Market Overview:
Charlotte experienced record-breaking supply in 2024 with 16,700 units delivered — a 25% increase from the prior year. Approximately 22,000 units were under construction at end of 2024, representing a 9.6% expansion of inventory. However, construction starts declined 40% year-over-year, signaling a supply tapering that should tighten the market by late 2026. Annual absorption reached approximately 12,700 units in 2024 — robust but insufficient to fully absorb the supply wave.

Rent Data (Q4 2025):
- Average asking rent: $1,578/month (metro-wide, trailing 3-month average)
- Class A effective rent per unit: $1,928 (Avison Young Q2 2025)
- Rent per square foot: approximately $1.82/sf/month (on ~870sf average Class A unit)
- Year-over-year rent growth: -0.3% (metro-wide, November 2025 — still digesting supply wave)
- Projected 2026 rent growth: 2.5-3.5% as supply pipeline dries up
- Zillow ZORI: Charlotte experienced one of the largest monthly drops in multifamily rents at -0.8% in November 2025

Occupancy/Vacancy:
- Overall metro occupancy: 91.6% (end of 2024)
- Class A occupancy: 85.5% (peak oversupply impact, 2024) → recovering toward 94.5% (Q2 2025)
- Class B occupancy: 92.3% (more resilient)
- Stabilized projection: 93-94% as supply absorption catches up

Cap Rates:
- Class A: 4.74% (CBRE Q1 2025, flat since Q4 2024)
- Class B: 5.25-5.50%
- Class C: 5.75-6.25%
- Median sale price per unit: approximately $200,000-$220,000 (varies by submarket)

- National average multifamily: $310/sf (Willowdale Equity, 2025)
- Charlotte has seen 36%+ construction cost appreciation since 2012 (outlier vs. national)

Key Submarkets for Development:

- NoDa (North Davidson): emerging arts district, lower land costs, strong absorption
- Uptown: CBD, mixed-use focus, higher construction costs
- University City: UNCC area, student-adjacent demand
- Ballantyne: suburban office/mixed-use corridor

SECTION 3: NASHVILLE, TN — MULTIFAMILY MARKET DATA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Market Overview:
Nashville's multifamily market is following a similar pattern to Charlotte — significant supply delivery followed by starts declining 781 permits year-over-year.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Market Overview:
Boston remains one of the most supply-constrained major markets in the US.
